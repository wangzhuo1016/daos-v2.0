Storage Operations \u00b6 Space Utilization \u00b6 To query SCM and NVMe storage space usage and show how much space is available to create new DAOS pools with, run the following command: bash-4.2$ dmg storage query usage Hosts SCM-Total SCM-Free SCM-Used NVMe-Total NVMe-Free NVMe-Used ----- --------- -------- -------- ---------- --------- --------- wolf-71 6.4 TB 2.0 TB 68 % 1.5 TB 1.1 TB 27 % wolf-72 6.4 TB 2.0 TB 68 % 1.5 TB 1.1 TB 27 % The command output shows online DAOS storage utilization, only including storage statistics for devices that have been formatted by DAOS control-plane and assigned to a currently running rank of the DAOS system. This represents the storage that can host DAOS pools. Note that the table values are per-host (storage server) and SCM/NVMe capacity pool component values specified in dmg pool create are per rank. If multiple ranks (I/O processes) have been configured per host in the server configuration file daos_server.yml then the values supplied to dmg pool create should be a maximum of the SCM/NVMe free space divided by the number of ranks per host. For example if 2.0 TB SCM and 10.0 TB NVMe free space is reported by dmg storage query usage and the server configuration file used to start the system specifies 2 I/O processes (2 \"server\" sections), the maximum pool size that can be specified is approximately dmg pool create -s 1T -n 5T (may need to specify slightly below the maximum to take account of negligible metadata overhead). Storage Scrubbing \u00b6 Support for end-to-end data integrity is planned for DAOS v1.2 and background checksum scrubbing for v2.2. Once available, that functionality will be documented here. SSD Management \u00b6 Health Monitoring \u00b6 Useful admin dmg commands to query NVMe SSD health: Query Per-Server Metadata: dmg storage query (list-devices|list-pools) dmg storage scan --nvme-meta shows mapping of metadata to NVMe controllers The NVMe storage query list-devices and list-pools commands query the persistently stored SMD device and pool tables respectively. The device table maps the internal device UUID to attached VOS target IDs. The rank number of the server where the device is located is also listed, along with the current device state. The current device states are the following: - NORMAL: a fully, functional device in-use by DAOS - EVICTED: the device is no longer in-use by DAOS - UNPLUGGED: the device is currently unplugged from the system (may or not be evicted) - NEW: the device is plugged and available, and not currently in-use by DAOS The transport address is also listed for the device. This is either the PCIe address for normal NVMe SSDs, or the BDF format address of the backing NVMe SSDs behind a VMD (Volume Management Device) address. In the example below, the last two listed devices are both VMD devices with transport addresses in the BDF format behind the VMD address 0000:5d:05.5. The pool table maps the DAOS pool UUID to attached VOS target IDs and will list all of the server ranks that the pool is distributed on. With the additional verbose flag, the mapping of SPDK blob IDs to VOS target IDs will also be displayed. $ dmg -l boro-11,boro-13 storage query list-devices ------- boro-11 ------- Devices UUID:5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 [TrAddr:0000:8a:00.0] Targets:[0 2] Rank:0 State:NORMAL UUID:80c9f1be-84b9-4318-a1be-c416c96ca48b [TrAddr:0000:8b:00.0] Targets:[1 3] Rank:0 State:NORMAL UUID:051b77e4-1524-4662-9f32-f8e4d2542c2d [TrAddr:0000:8c:00.0] Targets:[] Rank:0 State:NEW UUID:81905b24-be44-4106-8ff9-03002e9dd86a [TrAddr:5d0505:01:00.0] Targets:[0 2] Rank:1 State:EVICTED UUID:2ccb8afb-5d32-454e-86e3-762ec5dca7be [TrAddr:5d0505:03:00.0] Targets:[1 3] Rank:1 State:NORMAL $ dmg -l boro-11,boro-13 storage query list-pools ------- boro-11 ------- Pools UUID:08d6839b-c71a-4af6-901c-28e141b2b429 Rank:0 Targets:[0 1 2 3] Rank:1 Targets:[0 1 2 3] $ dmg -l boro-11,boro-13 storage query list-pools --verbose ------- boro-11 ------- Pools UUID:08d6839b-c71a-4af6-901c-28e141b2b429 Rank:0 Targets:[0 1 2 3] Blobs:[4294967404 4294967405 4294967407 4294967406] Rank:1 Targets:[0 1 2 3] Blobs:[4294967410 4294967411 4294967413 4294967412] Query Storage Device Health Data: dmg storage query (device-health|target-health) dmg storage scan --nvme-health shows NVMe controller health stats The NVMe storage query device-health and target-health commands query the device health data, including NVMe SSD health stats and in-memory I/O error and checksum error counters.

Note Full NVMe hot plug capability will be available and supported in DAOS 2.2 release. Use is currently intended for testing only and is not supported for production. Replace an Evicted SSD with a New Device: dmg storage replace nvme To replace an NVMe SSD with an evicted device and reintegrate it into use with DAOS, run the following command: $ dmg -l boro-11 storage replace nvme --old-uuid=5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 --new-uuid=80c9f1be-84b9-4318-a1be-c416c96ca48b ------- boro-11 ------- Devices UUID:80c9f1be-84b9-4318-a1be-c416c96ca48b Targets:[] Rank:1 State:NORMAL The old, now replaced device will remain in an \"EVICTED\" state until it is unplugged. The new device will transition from a \"NEW\" state to a \"NORMAL\" state (shown above). Reuse a FAULTY Device: dmg storage replace nvme In order to reuse a device that was previously set as FAULTY and evicted from the DAOS system, an admin can run the following command (setting the old device UUID to be the new device UUID): $ dmg -l boro-11 storage replace nvme --old-uuid=5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 --new-uuid=5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 ------- boro-11 ------- Devices UUID:5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 Targets:[] Rank:1 State:NORMAL The FAULTY device will transition from an \"EVICTED\" state back to a \"NORMAL\" state, and will again be available for use with DAOS. The use case of this command will mainly be for testing, or for accidental device eviction. Identification \u00b6 The SSD identification feature is simply a way to quickly and visually locate a device. It requires the use of Intel VMD (Volume Management Device), which needs to be physically available on the hardware as well as enabled in the system BIOS. The feature supports two LED device events: locating a healthy device and locating an evicted device. Locate a Healthy SSD: dmg storage identify vmd To quickly identify an SSD in question, an administrator can run the following command: $ dmg -l boro-11 storage identify vmd --uuid=6fccb374-413b-441a-bfbe-860099ac5e8d If a non-VMD device UUID is used with the command, the following error will occur: localhost DAOS error (-1010): DER_NOSYS The status LED on the VMD device is now set to an \"IDENTIFY\" state, represented by a quick, 4Hz blinking amber light. The device will quickly blink by default for about 60 seconds and then return to the default \"OFF\" state. The LED event duration can be customized by setting the VMD_LED_PERIOD environment variable if a duration other than the default value is desired. Locate an Evicted SSD: If an NVMe SSD is evicted, the status LED on the VMD device is set to a \"FAULT\" state, represented by a solidly ON amber light. No additional command apart from the SSD eviction command would be needed, and this would visually indicate that the device needs to be replaced and is no longer in use by DAOS. The LED of the VMD device would remain in this state until replaced by a new device. System Operations \u00b6 The DAOS Control Server acting as the access point records details of DAOS I/O Server instances that join the DAOS system. Once an I/O Engine has joined the DAOS system, it is identified by a unique system \"rank\". Multiple ranks can reside on the same host machine, accessible via the same network address. A DAOS system can be shutdown and restarted to perform maintenance and/or reboot hosts. Pool data and state will be maintained providing no changes are made to the rank's metadata stored on persistent memory. Storage reformat can also be performed after system shutdown. Pools will be removed and storage wiped. System commands will be handled by the DAOS Server listening at the access point address specified as the first entry in the DMG config file \"hostlist\" parameter. See daos_control.yml for details. The \"access point\" address should be the same as that specified in the server config file daos_server.yml specified when starting daos_server instances. Warning Controlled start/stop/reformat have some known limitations. Whilst individual system instances can be stopped, if a subset is restarted, existing pools will not be automatically integrated with restarted instances. Membership \u00b6 The system membership can be queried using the command: $ dmg system query [--verbose] [--ranks <rankset>|--host-ranks <hostset>] <rankset> is a pattern describing rank ranges e.g. 0,5-10,20-100 <hostset> is a pattern describing host ranges e.g. storagehost[0,5-10],10.8.1.[20-100] --verbose flag gives more information on each rank Output table will provide system rank mappings to host address and instance UUID, in addition to rank state. Shutdown \u00b6 When up and running, the entire system can be shutdown with the command: $ dmg system stop [--force] [--ranks <rankset>|--host-ranks <hostset>] <rankset> is a pattern describing rank ranges e.g. 0,5-10,20-100 <hostset> is a pattern describing host ranges e.g. storagehost[0,5-10],10.8.1.[20-100] Output table will indicate action and result. DAOS Control Servers will continue to operate and listen on the management network. Start \u00b6 To start the system after a controlled shutdown run the command: $ dmg system start [--ranks <rankset>|--host-ranks <hostset>] <rankset> is a pattern describing rank ranges e.g. 0,5-10,20-100 <hostset> is a pattern describing host ranges e.g. storagehost[0,5-10],10.8.1.[20-100] Output table will indicate action and result. DAOS I/O Engines will be started. Reformat \u00b6 To reformat the system after a controlled shutdown run the command: $ dmg storage format --reformat --reformat flag indicates that a reformat operation should be performed disregarding existing filesystems if no record of previously running ranks can be found, reformat is performed on hosts in dmg config file hostlist if system membership has records of previously running ranks, storage allocated to those ranks will be formatted Output table will indicate action and result. DAOS I/O Engines will be started and all DAOS pools will have been removed. Manual Fresh Start \u00b6 To reset the DAOS metadata across all hosts, the system must be reformatted. First, ensure all daos_server processes on all hosts have been stopped, then for each SCM mount specified in the config file ( scm_mount in the servers section) umount and wipe FS signatures. Example illustration with two IO instances specified in the config file: clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] umount /mnt/daos1 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] umount /mnt/daos0 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] wipefs -a /dev/pmem1 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] wipefs -a /dev/pmem0 Then restart DAOS Servers and format. Fault Domain \u00b6 Details on how to drain an individual storage node or fault domain (e.g. rack) in preparation for maintenance activity and how to reintegrate it will be provided in a future revision. System Extension \u00b6 Ability to add new DAOS server instances to a pre-existing DAOS system will be documented in a future revision. Fault Management \u00b6 DAOS relies on massively distributed single-ported storage. Each target is thus effectively a single point of failure. DAOS achieves availability and durability of both data and metadata by providing redundancy across targets in different fault domains. Fault Detection & Isolation \u00b6 DAOS servers are monitored within a DAOS system through a gossip-based protocol called SWIM 1 that provides accurate, efficient, and scalable server fault detection. Storage attached to each DAOS target is monitored through periodic local health assessment. Whenever a local storage I/O error is returned to the DAOS server, an internal health check procedure will be called automatically. This procedure makes an overall health assessment by analyzing the IO error code and device SMART/Health data. If the result is negative, the target will be marked as faulty, and further I/Os to this target will be rejected and re-routed. Once detected, the faulty target or servers (effectively a set of targets) must be excluded from each pool membership. This process is triggered either manually by the administrator or automatically (see the next section for more information). Upon exclusion from the pool map, each target starts the collective rebuild process automatically to restore data redundancy. The rebuild process is designed to operate online while servers continue to process incoming I/O operations from applications. Tools to monitor and manage rebuild are still under development. Rebuild Throttling \u00b6 The rebuild process may consume many resources on each server and can be throttled to reduce the impact on application performance. This current logic relies on CPU cycles on the storage nodes. By default, the rebuild process is configured to consume up to 30% of the CPU cycles, leaving the other 70% for regular I/O operations. During the rebuild process, the user can set the throttle to guarantee that the rebuild will not use more resources than the user setting. The user can only set the CPU cycle for now. For example, if the user set the throttle to 50, then the rebuild will at most use 50% of the CPU cycle to do the rebuild job. The default rebuild throttle for CPU cycle is 30. This parameter can be changed via the daos_mgmt_set_params() API call and will be eventually available through the management tools. Software Upgrade \u00b6 Interoperability in DAOS is handled via protocol and schema versioning for persistent data structures. Further instructions on how to manage DAOS software upgrades will be provided in a future revision. Protocol Interoperability \u00b6 Limited protocol interoperability is provided by the DAOS storage stack. Version compatibility checks will be performed to verify that: All targets in the same pool run the same protocol version. Client libraries linked with the application may be up to one protocol version older than the targets. If a protocol version mismatch is detected among storage targets in the same pool, the entire DAOS system will fail to start up and will report failure to the control API. Similarly, the connection from clients running a protocol version incompatible with the targets will return an error. Persistent Layout \u00b6 The schema of persistent data structures may evolve from time to time to fix bugs, add new optimizations, or support new features. To that end, the persistent data structures support schema versioning. Upgrading the schema version will not be performed automatically and must be initiated by the administrator. A dedicated upgrade tool will be provided to upgrade the schema version to the latest one. All targets in the same pool must have the same schema version. Version checks are performed at system initialization time to enforce this constraint. To limit the validation matrix, each new DAOS release will be published with a list of supported schema versions. To run with the new DAOS release, administrators will then need to upgrade the DAOS system to one of the supported schema versions. New pool shards will always be formatted with the latest version. This versioning schema only applies to a data structure stored in persistent memory and not to block storage that only stores user data with no metadata. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028914 \u21a9","title":"DAOS System Administration"},{"location":"QSG/admin/#daos-system-administration","text":"","title":"DAOS System Administration"},{"location":"QSG/admin/#system-ras-events","text":"Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS) related events are communicated and logged within DAOS.","title":"System RAS Events"},{"location":"QSG/admin/#ras-event-structure","text":"The following table describes the structure of a DAOS RAS event including descriptions of mandatory and optional fields.

This document includes instructions for CentOS. For setup instructions on OpenSuse, refer to the OpenSuse setup . For more details reference the DAOS administration guide: https://daos-stack.github.io/admin/hardware/ Requirements \u00b6 The following steps require two or more hosts which will be divided up into admin, client, and server roles. One node can be used for both the admin and client node. All nodes must have: sudo access configured password-less ssh configured pdsh installed (or some other means of running multiple remote commands in parallel) In addition the server nodes should also have: an InfiniBand network adapter configured one or more NVMe devices IOMMU is enabled: https://daos-stack.github.io/admin/predeployment_check/#enable-iommu-optional For the use of the commands outlined on this page the following shell variables will need to be defined: ADMIN_NODE CLIENT_NODES SERVER_NODES ALL_NODES For example, if you want to use node-1 as the admin node, node-2 and node-3 as client nodes, and node-[4-6] as server nodes, these variables would be defined as: ADMIN_NODE=node-1 CLIENT_NODES=node-2,node-3 SERVER_NODES=node-4,node-5,node-6 ALL_NODES=$ADMIN_NODE,$CLIENT_NODES,$SERVER_NODES Note If a client node is also serving as an admin node, exclude $ADMIN_NODE from the ALL_NODES assignment to prevent duplication. For example: ALL_NODES=$CLIENT_NODES,$SERVER_NODES RPM Installation \u00b6 In this section the required RPMs will be installed on each of the nodes based upon their role. Admin and client nodes require the installation of the daos-client RPM and the server nodes require the installation of the daos-server RPM. Configure access to the DAOS package repository at https://packages.daos.io/v1.2 . pdsh -w $ALL_NODES 'sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/daos-packages.repo https://packages.daos.io/v1.2/CentOS7/packages/x86_64/daos_packages.repo' Import GPG key on all nodes: pdsh -w $ALL_NODES 'sudo rpm --import https://packages.daos.io/RPM-GPG-KEY\\ Perform the additional steps: pdsh -w $ALL_NODES 'sudo yum install -y epel-release' Install the DAOS server RPMs on the server nodes: pdsh -w $SERVER_NODES 'sudo yum install -y daos-server' Install the DAOS client RPMs on the client and admin nodes: pdsh -w $ALL_NODES -x $SERVER_NODES 'sudo yum install -y daos-client' (Optionally) Install the DAOS test RPMs on the client nodes - typically not required pdsh -w $ALL_NODES -x $SERVER_NODES 'sudo yum install -y' daos-tests\\' Hardware Provisioning \u00b6 In this section, PMem (Intel(R) Optane(TM) persistent memory) and NVME SSDs will be prepared and configured to be used by DAOS. Note PMem preparation is required once per DAOS installation. Prepare the pmem devices on Server nodes: daos_server storage prepare --scm-only Sample Script: Preparing locally-attached SCM... Memory allocation goals for SCM will be changed and namespaces modified, this will be a destructive operation. Please ensure namespaces are unmounted and locally attached SCM & NVMe devices are not in use. Please be patient as it may take several minutes and subsequent reboot maybe required. Are you sure you want to continue? (yes/no) yes A reboot is required to process new SCM memory allocation goals. Reboot the server node.

This document covers installation of the DAOS rpms on openSUSE/SLES 15.2 and updating the DAOS configuration files needed by daos servers. This guide will also describe how to use dfuse in order to take advantage of DAOS support for POSIX. For setup instructions on CentOS, refer to the CentOS setup . For more details reference the DAOS administration guide: https://daos-stack.github.io/admin/hardware/ Requirements \u00b6 This Guide requires a minimum of: 1 server with PMEM and SSDs connected via infiniband storage network. 1 client node. 1 admin node without pmem/ssd but on the infiniband storage network. All nodes have a base openSUSE or SLES 15.2 installed. Install pdsh on the admin node The following steps require two or more hosts which will be divided up into admin, client, and server roles. One node can be used for both the admin and client node. All nodes must have: sudo access configured password-less ssh configured pdsh installed (or some other means of running multiple remote commands in parallel) In addition the server nodes should also have: an InfiniBand network adapter configured one or more NVMe devices IOMMU is enabled https://daos-stack.github.io/admin/predeployment_check/#enable-iommu-optional For the use of the commands outlined on this page the following shell variables will need to be defined: ADMIN_NODE CLIENT_NODES SERVER_NODES ALL_NODES For example, if one wanted to use node-1 as their admin node, node-2 and node-3 as client nodes, and node-[4-6] as their server nodes then these variables would be defined as: ADMIN_NODE=node-1 CLIENT_NODES=node-2,node-3 SERVER_NODES=node-4,node-5,node-6 ALL_NODES=$ADMIN_NODE,$CLIENT_NODES,$SERVER_NODES Note If a client node is also serving as an admin node, exclude $ADMIN_NODE from the ALL_NODES assignment to prevent duplication. For example: ALL_NODES=$CLIENT_NODES,$SERVER_NODES RPM Installation \u00b6 In this section the required RPMs will be installed on each of the nodes based upon their role. Admin and client nodes require the installation of the daos-client RPM and the server nodes require the installation of the daos-server RPM. Configure access to the DAOS package repository at https://packages.daos.io/v1.2 . pdsh -w $ALL_NODES 'sudo zypper ar https://packages.daos.io/v1.2/Leap15/packages/x86_64/ daos_packages' Import GPG key on all nodes: pdsh -w $ALL_NODES 'sudo rpm --import' https://packages.daos.io/RPM-GPG-KEY\\ Perform the additional steps: pdsh -w $ALL_NODES 'sudo zypper --non-interactive refresh' Install the DAOS server RPMs on the server nodes: pdsh -w $SERVER_NODES 'sudo zypper install -y daos-server' Install the DAOS client RPMs on the client and admin nodes: pdsh -w $ALL_NODES -x $SERVER_NODES 'sudo zypper install -y daos-client' (Optionally) Install the DAOS test RPMs on the client nodes - typically not required pdsh -w $ALL_NODES -x $SERVER_NODES 'sudo zypper install -y daos-tests' Hardware Provisioning \u00b6 In this section, PMem (Intel(R) Optane(TM) persistent memory) and NVME SSDs will be prepared and configured to be used by DAOS. Note PMem preparation is required once per DAOS installation. Note For OpenSUSE 15.2 installation, update ipmctl to the latest package available from https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/hardware:nvdimm/ipmctl/openSUSE_Leap_15.2 Prepare the pmem devices on Server nodes: daos_server storage prepare --scm-only Sample Script: Preparing locally-attached SCM\\... Memory allocation goals for SCM will be changed and namespaces modified, this will be a destructive operation. Please ensure namespaces are unmounted and locally attached SCM & NVMe devices are not in use. Please be patient as it may take several minutes and subsequent reboot maybe required. Are you sure you want to continue? (yes/no) yes A reboot is required to process new SCM memory allocation goals. Reboot the server node.

Administrative nodes require the following certificate files: CA root certificate (daosCA.crt) owned by the current user Admin certificate (admin.crt) owned by the current user Admin key (admin.key) owned by the current user Client nodes require the following certificate files: CA root certificate (daosCa.crt) owned by the current user Agent certificate (agent.crt) owned by the daos_agent user Agent key (agent.key) owned by the daos_agent user Server nodes require the following certificate files: CA root certificate (daosCA.crt) owned by the daos_server user Server certificate (server.crt) owned by the daos_server user Server key (server.key) owned by the daos_server user A copy of the Client certificate (client.crt) owned by the daos_server user See https://daos-stack.github.io/admin/deployment/#certificate-configuration for more informaation. Note The following commands are run from the $ADMIN_NODE . Generate a new set of certificates: cd /tmp /usr/lib64/daos/certgen/gen_certificates.sh Note These files should be protected from unauthorized access and preserved for future use. Copy the certificates to a common location on each node in order to move them to the final location: pdsh -S -w $ALL_NODES -x $(hostname -s) scp -r $(hostname -s):/tmp/daosCA /tmp Copy the certificates to their default location (/etc/daos) on each admin node: pdsh -S -w $ADMIN_NODE sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt /etc/daos/certs/. pdsh -S -w $ADMIN_NODE sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/admin.crt /etc/daos/certs/. pdsh -S -w $ADMIN_NODE sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/admin.key /etc/daos/certs/. Note If the /etc/daos/certs directory does not exist on the admin nodes then use the following command to create it: pdsh -S -w $ADMIN_NODES sudo mkdir /etc/daos/certs Copy the certificates to their default location (/etc/daos) on each client node: pdsh -S -w $CLIENT_NODES sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt /etc/daos/certs/. pdsh -S -w $CLIENT_NODES sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/agent.crt /etc/daos/certs/. pdsh -S -w $CLIENT_NODES sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/agent.key /etc/daos/certs/. Note If the /etc/daos/certs directory does not exist on the client nodes, use the following command to create it: pdsh -S -w $CLIENT_NODES sudo mkdir /etc/daos/certs Copy the certificates to their default location (/etc/daos) on each server node: pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt /etc/daos/certs/. pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/server.crt /etc/daos/certs/. pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/server.key /etc/daos/certs/. pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo cp /tmp/daosCA/certs/agent.crt /etc/daos/certs/clients/agent.crt Set the ownership of the admin certificates on each admin node: pdsh -S -w $ADMIN_NODE sudo chown $USER:$USER /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt pdsh -S -w $ADMIN_NODE sudo chown $USER:$USER /etc/daos/certs/admin.* Set the ownership of the client certificates on each client node: pdsh -S -w $CLIENT_NODES sudo chown $USER:$USER /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt pdsh -S -w $CLIENT_NODES sudo chown daos_agent:daos_agent /etc/daos/certs/agent.* Set the ownership of the server certificates on each server node: pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo chown daos_server:daos_server /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo chown daos_server:daos_server /etc/daos/certs/server.* pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo chown daos_server:daos_server /etc/daos/certs/clients/agent.crt pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo chown daos_server:daos_server /etc/daos/certs/clients Create Configuration Files \u00b6 In this section the daos_server , daos_agent , and dmg command configuration files will be defined. Examples are available at https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/release/1.2/utils/config/examples Determine the addresses for the NVMe devices on the server nodes: pdsh -S -w $SERVER_NODES sudo lspci | grep -i nvme Note Save the addresses of the NVMe devices to use with each DAOS server, e.g. \"81:00.0\", from each server node. This information will be used to populate the \"bdev_list\" server configuration parameter below. Create a server configuration file by modifying the default /etc/daos/daos_server.yml file on the server nodes. An example of the daos_server.yml is presented below. Copy the modified server yaml file to all the server nodes at `/etc/daos/daos_server.yml.

This represents the storage that can host DAOS pools. Note that the table values are per-host (storage server) and SCM/NVMe capacity pool component values specified in dmg pool create are per rank. If multiple ranks (I/O processes) have been configured per host in the server configuration file daos_server.yml then the values supplied to dmg pool create should be a maximum of the SCM/NVMe free space divided by the number of ranks per host. For example if 2.0 TB SCM and 10.0 TB NVMe free space is reported by dmg storage query usage and the server configuration file used to start the system specifies 2 I/O processes (2 \"server\" sections), the maximum pool size that can be specified is approximately dmg pool create -s 1T -n 5T (may need to specify slightly below the maximum to take account of negligible metadata overhead). NVMe SSD Health Monitoring \u00b6 Useful admin dmg commands to query NVMe SSD health: Query Per-Server Metadata: dmg storage query (list-devices|list-pools) dmg storage scan --nvme-meta shows mapping of metadata to NVMe controllers The NVMe storage query list-devices and list-pools commands query the persistently stored SMD device and pool tables respectively. The device table maps the internal device UUID to attached VOS target IDs. The rank number of the server where the device is located is also listed, along with the current device state. The current device states are the following: - NORMAL: a fully, functional device in-use by DAOS - EVICTED: the device is no longer in-use by DAOS - UNPLUGGED: the device is currently unplugged from the system (may or not be evicted) - NEW: the device is plugged and available, and not currently in-use by DAOS The transport address is also listed for the device. This is either the PCIe address for normal NVMe SSDs, or the BDF format address of the backing NVMe SSDs behind a VMD (Volume Management Device) address. In the example below, the last two listed devices are both VMD devices with transport addresses in the BDF format behind the VMD address 0000:5d:05.5. The pool table maps the DAOS pool UUID to attached VOS target IDs and will list all of the server ranks that the pool is distributed on. With the additional verbose flag, the mapping of SPDK blob IDs to VOS target IDs will also be displayed. $ dmg -l boro-11,boro-13 storage query list-devices ------- boro-11 ------- Devices UUID:5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 [TrAddr:0000:8a:00.0] Targets:[0 2] Rank:0 State:NORMAL UUID:80c9f1be-84b9-4318-a1be-c416c96ca48b [TrAddr:0000:8b:00.0] Targets:[1 3] Rank:0 State:NORMAL UUID:051b77e4-1524-4662-9f32-f8e4d2542c2d [TrAddr:0000:8c:00.0] Targets:[] Rank:0 State:NEW UUID:81905b24-be44-4106-8ff9-03002e9dd86a [TrAddr:5d0505:01:00.0] Targets:[0 2] Rank:1 State:EVICTED UUID:2ccb8afb-5d32-454e-86e3-762ec5dca7be [TrAddr:5d0505:03:00.0] Targets:[1 3] Rank:1 State:NORMAL $ dmg -l boro-11,boro-13 storage query list-pools ------- boro-11 ------- Pools UUID:08d6839b-c71a-4af6-901c-28e141b2b429 Rank:0 Targets:[0 1 2 3] Rank:1 Targets:[0 1 2 3] $ dmg -l boro-11,boro-13 storage query list-pools --verbose ------- boro-11 ------- Pools UUID:08d6839b-c71a-4af6-901c-28e141b2b429 Rank:0 Targets:[0 1 2 3] Blobs:[4294967404 4294967405 4294967407 4294967406] Rank:1 Targets:[0 1 2 3] Blobs:[4294967410 4294967411 4294967413 4294967412] Query Storage Device Health Data: dmg storage query (device-health|target-health) dmg storage scan --nvme-health shows NVMe controller health stats The NVMe storage query device-health and target-health commands query the device health data, including NVMe SSD health stats and in-memory I/O error and checksum error counters.

Full NVMe hot plug capability will be available and supported in DAOS 2.0 release. Use is currently intended for testing only and is not supported for production. Replace an Evicted SSD with a New Device: dmg storage replace nvme To replace an NVMe SSD with an evicted device and reintegrate it into use with DAOS, run the following command: $ dmg -l boro-11 storage replace nvme --old-uuid=5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 --new-uuid=80c9f1be-84b9-4318-a1be-c416c96ca48b ------- boro-11 ------- Devices UUID:80c9f1be-84b9-4318-a1be-c416c96ca48b Targets:[] Rank:1 State:NORMAL The old, now replaced device will remain in an \"EVICTED\" state until it is unplugged. The new device will transition from a \"NEW\" state to a \"NORMAL\" state (shown above). Reuse a FAULTY Device: dmg storage replace nvme In order to reuse a device that was previously set as FAULTY and evicted from the DAOS system, an admin can run the following command (setting the old device UUID to be the new device UUID): $ dmg -l boro-11 storage replace nvme --old-uuid=5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 --new-uuid=5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 ------- boro-11 ------- Devices UUID:5bd91603-d3c7-4fb7-9a71-76bc25690c19 Targets:[] Rank:1 State:NORMAL The FAULTY device will transition from an \"EVICTED\" state back to a \"NORMAL\" state, and will again be available for use with DAOS. The use case of this command will mainly be for testing, or for accidental device eviction. NVMe SSD Identification \u00b6 The SSD identification feature is simply a way to quickly and visually locate a device. It requires the use of Intel VMD (Volume Management Device), which needs to be physically available on the hardware as well as enabled in the system BIOS. The feature supports two LED device events: locating a healthy device and locating an evicted device. Locate a Healthy SSD: dmg storage identify vmd To quickly identify an SSD in question, an administrator can run the following command: $ dmg -l boro-11 storage identify vmd --uuid=6fccb374-413b-441a-bfbe-860099ac5e8d If a non-VMD device UUID is used with the command, the following error will occur: localhost DAOS error (-1010): DER_NOSYS The status LED on the VMD device is now set to an \"IDENTIFY\" state, represented by a quick, 4Hz blinking amber light. The device will quickly blink by default for about 60 seconds and then return to the default \"OFF\" state. Locate an Evicted SSD: If an NVMe SSD is evicted, the status LED on the VMD device is set to a \"FAULT\" state, represented by a solidly ON amber light. No additional command apart from the SSD eviction command would be needed, and this would visually indicate that the device needs to be replaced and is no longer in use by DAOS. The LED of the VMD device would remain in this state until replaced by a new device. System Operations \u00b6 The DAOS Control Server acting as the access point records details of DAOS I/O Server instances that join the DAOS system. Once an I/O Engine has joined the DAOS system, it is identified by a unique system \"rank\". Multiple ranks can reside on the same host machine, accessible via the same network address. A DAOS system can be shutdown and restarted to perform maintenance and/or reboot hosts. Pool data and state will be maintained providing no changes are made to the rank's metadata stored on persistent memory. Storage reformat can also be performed after system shutdown. Pools will be removed and storage wiped. System commands will be handled by the DAOS Server listening at the access point address specified as the first entry in the DMG config file \"hostlist\" parameter. See daos_control.yml for details. The \"access point\" address should be the same as that specified in the server config file daos_server.yml specified when starting daos_server instances. Warning Controlled start/stop/reformat have some known limitations. Whilst individual system instances can be stopped, if a subset is restarted, existing pools will not be automatically integrated with restarted instances. Query \u00b6 The system membership can be queried using the command: $ dmg system query [--verbose] [--ranks <rankset>|--host-ranks <hostset>] <rankset> is a pattern describing rank ranges e.g. 0,5-10,20-100 <hostset> is a pattern describing host ranges e.g. storagehost[0,5-10],10.8.1.[20-100] --verbose flag gives more information on each rank Output table will provide system rank mappings to host address and instance UUID, in addition to rank state. Shutdown \u00b6 When up and running, the entire system can be shutdown with the command: $ dmg system stop [--force] [--ranks <rankset>|--host-ranks <hostset>] <rankset> is a pattern describing rank ranges e.g. 0,5-10,20-100 <hostset> is a pattern describing host ranges e.g. storagehost[0,5-10],10.8.1.[20-100] Output table will indicate action and result. DAOS Control Servers will continue to operate and listen on the management network. Start \u00b6 To start the system after a controlled shutdown run the command: $ dmg system start [--ranks <rankset>|--host-ranks <hostset>] <rankset> is a pattern describing rank ranges e.g. 0,5-10,20-100 <hostset> is a pattern describing host ranges e.g. storagehost[0,5-10],10.8.1.[20-100] Output table will indicate action and result. DAOS I/O Engines will be started. Reformat \u00b6 To reformat the system after a controlled shutdown run the command: $ dmg storage format --reformat --reformat flag indicates that a reformat operation should be performed disregarding existing filesystems if no record of previously running ranks can be found, reformat is performed on hosts in dmg config file hostlist if system membership has records of previously running ranks, storage allocated to those ranks will be formatted Output table will indicate action and result. DAOS I/O Engines will be started and all DAOS pools will have been removed. Manual Fresh Start \u00b6 To reset the DAOS metadata across all hosts, the system must be reformatted. First, ensure all daos_server processes on all hosts have been stopped, then for each SCM mount specified in the config file ( scm_mount in the servers section) umount and wipe FS signatures. Example illustration with two IO instances specified in the config file: clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] umount /mnt/daos1 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] umount /mnt/daos0 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] wipefs -a /dev/pmem1 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] wipefs -a /dev/pmem0 Then restart DAOS Servers and format. Fault Domain Maintenance and Reintegration \u00b6 Details on how to drain an individual storage node or fault domain (e.g. rack) in preparation for maintenance activity and how to reintegrate it will be provided in a future revision. DAOS System Extension \u00b6 Ability to add new DAOS server instances to a pre-existing DAOS system will be documented in a future revision. Fault Management \u00b6 DAOS relies on massively distributed single-ported storage. Each target is thus effectively a single point of failure. DAOS achieves availability and durability of both data and metadata by providing redundancy across targets in different fault domains. Fault Detection & Isolation \u00b6 DAOS servers are monitored within a DAOS system through a gossip-based protocol called SWIM 1 that provides accurate, efficient, and scalable server fault detection. Storage attached to each DAOS target is monitored through periodic local health assessment. Whenever a local storage I/O error is returned to the DAOS server, an internal health check procedure will be called automatically. This procedure makes an overall health assessment by analyzing the IO error code and device SMART/Health data. If the result is negative, the target will be marked as faulty, and further I/Os to this target will be rejected and re-routed. Once detected, the faulty target or servers (effectively a set of targets) must be excluded from each pool membership. This process is triggered either manually by the administrator or automatically (see the next section for more information). Upon exclusion from the pool map, each target starts the collective rebuild process automatically to restore data redundancy. The rebuild process is designed to operate online while servers continue to process incoming I/O operations from applications. Tools to monitor and manage rebuild are still under development. Rebuild Throttling \u00b6 The rebuild process may consume many resources on each server and can be throttled to reduce the impact on application performance. This current logic relies on CPU cycles on the storage nodes. By default, the rebuild process is configured to consume up to 30% of the CPU cycles, leaving the other 70% for regular I/O operations. During the rebuild process, the user can set the throttle to guarantee that the rebuild will not use more resources than the user setting. The user can only set the CPU cycle for now. For example, if the user set the throttle to 50, then the rebuild will at most use 50% of the CPU cycle to do the rebuild job. The default rebuild throttle for CPU cycle is 30. This parameter can be changed via the daos_mgmt_set_params() API call and will be eventually available through the management tools. Software Upgrade \u00b6 Interoperability in DAOS is handled via protocol and schema versioning for persistent data structures. Further instructions on how to manage DAOS software upgrades will be provided in a future revision. Protocol Interoperability \u00b6 Limited protocol interoperability is provided by the DAOS storage stack. Version compatibility checks will be performed to verify that: All targets in the same pool run the same protocol version. Client libraries linked with the application may be up to one protocol version older than the targets. If a protocol version mismatch is detected among storage targets in the same pool, the entire DAOS system will fail to start up and will report failure to the control API. Similarly, the connection from clients running a protocol version incompatible with the targets will return an error. Persistent Schema Compatibility and Update \u00b6 The schema of persistent data structures may evolve from time to time to fix bugs, add new optimizations, or support new features. To that end, the persistent data structures support schema versioning. Upgrading the schema version will not be performed automatically and must be initiated by the administrator. A dedicated upgrade tool will be provided to upgrade the schema version to the latest one. All targets in the same pool must have the same schema version. Version checks are performed at system initialization time to enforce this constraint. To limit the validation matrix, each new DAOS release will be published with a list of supported schema versions. To run with the new DAOS release, administrators will then need to upgrade the DAOS system to one of the supported schema versions. New pool shards will always be formatted with the latest version. This versioning schema only applies to a data structure stored in persistent memory and not to block storage that only stores user data with no metadata. Storage Scrubbing \u00b6 Support for end-to-end data integrity is planned for DAOS v1.2 and background checksum scrubbing for v2.2. Once available, that functionality will be documented here. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028914 \u21a9","title":"System Administration"},{"location":"admin/administration/#daos-system-administration","text":"","title":"DAOS System Administration"},{"location":"admin/administration/#system-monitoring","text":"System monitoring and telemetry data will be provided as part of the control plane and will be documented in a future revision.","title":"System Monitoring"},{"location":"admin/administration/#storage-operations","text":"","title":"Storage Operations"},{"location":"admin/administration/#per-storage-server-space-utilization","text":"To query SCM and NVMe storage space usage and show how much space is available to create new DAOS pools with, run the following command: bash-4.2$ dmg storage query usage Hosts SCM-Total SCM-Free SCM-Used NVMe-Total NVMe-Free NVMe-Used ----- --------- -------- -------- ---------- --------- --------- wolf-71 6.4 TB 2.0 TB 68 % 1.5 TB 1.1 TB 27 % wolf-72 6.4 TB 2.0 TB 68 % 1.5 TB 1.1 TB 27 % The command output shows online DAOS storage utilization, only including storage statistics for devices that have been formatted by DAOS control-plane and assigned to a currently running rank of the DAOS system.

Security is guaranteed via the use of certificates. The first type of commands run after installation include network and storage hardware provisioning and would typically be run from a login node. After daos_server instances have been started on each storage node for the first time, daos_server storage prepare --scm-only will set PMem storage into the necessary state for use with DAOS when run on each host. Then dmg storage format formats persistent storage devices (specified in the server configuration file) on the storage nodes and writes necessary metadata before starting DAOS Engine processes that will operate across the fabric. To sum up, the typical workflow of a DAOS system deployment consists of the following steps: Configure and start the DAOS server . Provision Hardware on all the storage nodes via the dmg utility. Format the DAOS system Set up and start the agent on the client nodes Validate that the DAOS system is operational Note that starting the DAOS server instances can be performed automatically on boot if start-up scripts are registered with systemd. The following subsections will cover each step in more detail. DAOS Server Setup \u00b6 First of all, the DAOS server should be started to allow remote administration command to be executed via the dmg tool. This section describes the minimal DAOS server configuration and how to start it on all the storage nodes. Example RPM Deployment Workflow \u00b6 A recommended workflow to get up and running is as follows: Install DAOS Server RPMs - daos_server systemd services will start in listening mode which means DAOS Engine processes will not be started as the server config file (default location at /etc/daos/daos_server.yml ) has not yet been populated. Run dmg config generate -l <hostset> -a <access_points> across the entire hostset (all the storage servers that are now running the daos_server service after RPM install). The command will only generate a config if hardware setups on all the hosts are similar and have been given sensible NUMA mappings. Adjust the hostset until you have a set with homogeneous hardware configurations. Once a recommended config file can be generated, copy it to the server config file default location ( /etc/daos/daos_server.yml ) on each DAOS Server host and restart all daos_server services. An example command to restart the services is clush -w machines-[118-121,130-133] \"sudo systemctl restart daos_server\" . The services should prompt for format on restart and after format is triggered from dmg , the DAOS Engine processes should start. Server Configuration File \u00b6 The daos_server configuration file is parsed when starting the daos_server process. The configuration file location can be specified on the command line ( daos_server -h for usage) or it will be read from the default location ( /etc/daos/daos_server.yml ). Parameter descriptions are specified in daos_server.yml and example configuration files in the examples directory. Any option supplied to daos_server as a command line option or flag will take precedence over equivalent configuration file parameter. For convenience, active parsed configuration values are written to a temporary file for reference, and the location will be written to the log. Configuration Options \u00b6 The example configuration file lists the default empty configuration, listing all the options (living documentation of the config file). Live examples are available at https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/utils/config/examples The location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the path specified through the -o option of the daos_server command line, if unspecified then /etc/daos/daos_server.yml is used. Refer to the example configuration file ( daos_server.yml ) for latest information and examples. At this point of the process, the servers: and provider: section of the yaml file can be left blank and will be populated in the subsequent sections. Auto generate configuration file \u00b6 DAOS can attempt to produce a server configuration file that makes optimal use of hardware on a given set of hosts through the 'dmg config generate' command: $ dmg config generate --help ERROR: dmg: Usage: dmg [OPTIONS] config generate [generate-OPTIONS] Application Options: ... -l, --host-list= comma separated list of addresses <ipv4addr/hostname> ... [generate command options] -a, --access-points= Comma separated list of access point addresses <ipv4addr/hostname> -e, --num-engines= Set the number of DAOS Engine sections to be populated in the config file output. If unset then the value will be set to the number of NUMA nodes on storage hosts in the DAOS system. -s, --min-ssds= Minimum number of NVMe SSDs required per DAOS Engine (SSDs must reside on the host that is managing the engine). Set to 0 to generate a config with no NVMe. (default: 1) -c, --net-class=[best-available|ethernet|infiniband] Network class preferred (default: best-available) The command will output recommended config file if supplied requirements are met. Requirements will be derived based on the number of NUMA nodes present on the hosts if '--num-engines' is not specified on the commandline. '--num-engines' specifies the number of engine sections to populate in the config file output. Each section will specify a persistent memory (PMem) block devices that must be present on the host in addition to a fabric network interface and SSDs all bound to the same NUMA node. If not set explicitly on the commandline, default is the number of NUMA nodes detected on the host. '--min-ssds' specifies the minimum number of NVMe SSDs per-engine that need to be present on each host. For each engine entry in the generated config, at least this number of SSDs must be bound to the NUMA node that matches the affinity of the PMem device and fabric network interface associated with the engine. If not set on the commandline, default is \"1\". If set to \"0\" NVMe SSDs will not be added to the generated config and SSD validation will be disabled. '--net-class' specifies preference for network interface class, options are 'ethernet', 'infiband' or 'best-available'. 'best-available' will attempt to choose the most performant (as judged by libfabric) sets of interfaces and supported provider that match the number and NUMA affinity of PMem devices. If not set on the commandline, default is \"best-available\". The configuration file that is generated by the command and output to stdout can be copied to a file and used on the relevant hosts and used as server config to determine the starting environment for 'daos_server' instances. Config file output will not be generated in the following cases: - PMem device count, capacity or NUMA mappings differ on any of the hosts in the hostlist (the hostlist can be specified either in the 'dmg' config file or on the commandline). - NVMe SSD count, PCI address distribution or NUMA affinity differs on any of the hosts in the host list. - NUMA node count can't be detected on the hosts or differs on any host in the host list. - PMem device count or NUMA affinity doesn't meet the 'num-engines' requirement. - NVMe device count or NUMA affinity doesn't meet the 'min-ssds' requirement. - network device count or NUMA affinity doesn't match the configured PMem devices, taking into account any specified network device class preference (ethernet or infiniband). Some CentOS 7.x kernels from before the 7.9 release were known to have a defect that prevented ndctl from being able to report the NUMA affinity for a namespace. This prevents generation of dual engine configs using dmg config generate when running with one of the above-mentioned affected kernels. Certificate Configuration \u00b6 The DAOS security framework relies on certificates to authenticate components and administrators in addition to encrypting DAOS control plane communications. A set of certificates for a given DAOS system may be generated by running the gen_certificates.sh script provided with the DAOS software if there is not an existing TLS certificate infrastructure. The gen_certificates.sh script uses the openssl tool to generate all of the necessary files. We highly recommend using OpenSSL Version 1.1.1h or higher as keys and certificates generated with earlier versions are vulnerable to attack. When DAOS is installed from RPMs, this script is provided in the base daos RPM, and may be invoked in the directory to which the certificates will be written. As part of the generation process, a new local Certificate Authority is created to handle certificate signing, and three role certificates are created: # /usr/lib64/daos/certgen/gen_certificates.sh Generating Private CA Root Certificate Private CA Root Certificate created in ./daosCA ... Generating Server Certificate Required Server Certificate Files: ./daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt ./daosCA/certs/server.key ./daosCA/certs/server.crt ... Generating Agent Certificate Required Agent Certificate Files: ./daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt ./daosCA/certs/agent.key ./daosCA/certs/agent.crt ... Generating Admin Certificate Required Admin Certificate Files: ./daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt ./daosCA/certs/admin.key ./daosCA/certs/admin.crt The files generated under ./daosCA should be protected from unauthorized access and preserved for future use. The generated keys and certificates must then be securely distributed to all nodes participating in the DAOS system (servers, clients, and admin nodes). Permissions for these files should be set to prevent unauthorized access to the keys and certificates. Client nodes require: - CA root cert - Agent cert - Agent key Administrative nodes require: - CA root cert - Admin cert - Admin key Server nodes require: - CA root cert - Server cert - Server key - All valid agent certs in the DAOS system (in the client cert directory, see config file below) After the certificates have been securely distributed, the DAOS configuration files must be updated in order to enable authentication and secure communications. These examples assume that the configuration files have been installed under /etc/daos and certificate files under /etc/daos/certs and /etc/daos/certs/clients . certs directory should have root ownership and 755 permissions and clients directory should have daos_server ownernship and 700 permissions: # /etc/daos/daos_server.yml (servers) transport_config: # Location where daos_server will look for Client certificates client_cert_dir: /etc/daos/certs/clients # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs ca_cert: /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt # Server certificate for use in TLS handshakes cert: /etc/daos/certs/server.crt # Key portion of Server Certificate key: /etc/daos/certs/server.key # /etc/daos/daos_agent.yml (clients) transport_config: # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs ca_cert: /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt # Agent certificate for use in TLS handshakes cert: /etc/daos/certs/agent.crt # Key portion of Agent Certificate key: /etc/daos/certs/agent.key # /etc/daos/daos_control.yml (dmg/admin) transport_config: # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs ca_cert: /etc/daos/certs/daosCA.crt # Admin certificate for use in TLS handshakes cert: /etc/daos/certs/admin.crt # Key portion of Admin Certificate key: /etc/daos/certs/admin.key Server Startup \u00b6 One instance of the daos_server process is to be started per storage node. The server can be started either individually (e.g. independently on each storage node via systemd) or collectively (e.g. pdsh, mpirun or as a Kubernetes Pod). Parallel Launcher \u00b6 Practically any parallel launcher can be used to start the DAOS server collectively on a set of storage nodes. pdsh, clush and orterun are most commonly used. $ clush -w <server_list> -o \"-t -t\" daos_server start -o <config_file>` will launch daos_server on the specified hosts connecting to the port parameter value specified in the server config file. If the number of storage node exceed the default fanout value, then \"-f\" followed by the number of storage nodes should be used. Similarly, pdsh can be used: $ pdsh -w <server_list> daos_server start -o <config_file>` As for orterun, the list of storage nodes can be specified on the command line via the -H option. To start the DAOS server, run: $ orterun --map-by node --mca btl tcp,self --mca oob tcp -np <num_servers> -H <server_list> --enable-recovery daos_server start -o <config_file> The --enable-recovery is required for fault tolerance to guarantee that the fault of one server does not cause the others to be stopped. The --allow-run-as-root option can be added to the command line to allow the daos_server to run with root privileges on each storage nodes (for example when needing to perform privileged tasks relating to storage format). See the orterun(1) man page for additional options. Systemd Integration \u00b6 The DAOS Server can be started as a systemd service. The DAOS Server unit file is installed in the correct location when installing from RPMs. The DAOS Server will be run as daos-server user which will be created during RPM install. If you wish to use systemd with a development build, you must copy the service file from utils/systemd to /usr/lib/systemd/system . Once the file is copied, modify the ExecStart line to point to your daos_server binary. After modifying ExecStart, run the following command: $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload Once the service file is installed you can start daos_server with the following commands: $ systemctl enable daos_server.service $ systemctl start daos_server.service To check the component status use: $ systemctl status daos_server.service If DAOS Server failed to start, check the logs with: $ journalctl --unit daos_server.service After RPM install, daos_server service starts automatically running as user \"daos\". The server config is read from /etc/daos/daos_server.yml and certificates are read from /etc/daos/certs . With no other admin intervention other than the loading of certificates, daos_server will enter a listening state enabling discovery of storage and network hardware through the dmg tool without any I/O Engines specified in the configuration file. After device discovery and provisioning, an updated configuration file with a populated per-engine section can be stored in /etc/daos/daos_server.yml , and after reestarting the daos_server service it is then ready for the storage to be formatted. Kubernetes Pod \u00b6 DAOS service integration with Kubernetes is planned and will be supported in a future DAOS version. DAOS Server Remote Access \u00b6 Remote tasking of the DAOS system and individual DAOS Server processes can be performed via the dmg utility. To set the addresses of which DAOS Servers to task, provide either: - -l <hostlist> on the commandline when invoking, or - hostlist: <hostlist> in the control configuration file daos_control.yml Where <hostlist> represents a slurm-style hostlist string e.g. foo-1[28-63],bar[256-511] . The first entry in the hostlist (after alphabetic then numeric sorting) will be assumed to be the access point as set in the server configuration file. Local configuration files stored in the user directory will be used in preference to the default location e.g. ~/.daos_control.yml . Hardware Provisioning \u00b6 Once the DAOS server started, the storage and network can be configured on the storage nodes via the dmg utility. SCM Preparation \u00b6 This section addresses how to verify that PMem (Intel(R) Optane(TM) persistent memory) modules are correctly installed on the storage nodes and how to configure in interleaved mode to be used by DAOS. Instructions for other types of SCM may be covered in the future. Provisioning the SCM occurs by configuring PMem modules in interleaved memory regions (interleaved mode) in groups of modules local to a specific socket (NUMA), and resultant nvdimm namespaces are defined by a device identifier (e.g., /dev/pmem0). PMem preparation is required once per DAOS installation. This step requires a reboot to enable PMem resource allocation changes to be read by BIOS. PMem preparation can be performed with daos_server storage prepare --scm-only . The first time the command is run, the SCM interleaved regions will be created as resource allocations on any available PMem modules (one region per NUMA node/socket). The regions are activated after BIOS reads the new resource allocations. Upon completion, the storage prepare command will prompt the admin to reboot the storage node(s) in order for the BIOS to activate the new storage allocations. The storage prepare command does not initiate the reboot itself. After running the command a reboot will be required, the command will then need to be run for a second time to expose the namespace device to be used by DAOS. Example usage: clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] daos_server storage prepare --scm-only after running, the user should be prompted for a reboot. clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] reboot clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] daos_server storage prepare --scm-only after running, PMem devices (/dev/pmemX namespaces created on the new SCM regions) should be available on each of the hosts. On the second run, one namespace per region is created, and each namespace may take up to a few minutes to create. Details of the pmem devices will be displayed in JSON format on command completion. Upon successful creation of the pmem devices, the Intel(R) Optane(TM) persistent memory is configured and one can move on to the next step. If required, the pmem devices can be destroyed with the command daos_server storage prepare --scm-only --reset . All namespaces are disabled and destroyed. The SCM regions are removed by resetting modules into \"MemoryMode\" through resource allocations. Note that undefined behavior may result if the namespaces/pmem kernel devices are mounted before running reset (as per the printed warning). A subsequent reboot is required for BIOS to read the new resource allocations. Storage Selection \u00b6 While the DAOS server auto-detects all the usable storage, the administrator will still be provided with the ability through the configuration file (see next section) to whitelist or blacklist the storage devices to be (or not) used. This section covers how to manually detect the storage devices potentially usable by DAOS to populate the configuration file when the administrator wants to have finer control over the storage selection. dmg storage scan can be run to query remote running daos_server processes over the management network. daos_server storage scan can be used to query daos_server directly (scans locally-attached SSDs and Intel Persistent Memory Modules usable by DAOS) but SSDs need to be made accessible first by running daos_server storage prepare --nvme-only -u <current_user first. The output will be equivalent running dmg storage scan --verbose remotely. bash-4.2$ dmg storage scan Hosts SCM Total NVMe Total ----- --------- ---------- wolf-[71-72] 6.4 TB (2 namespaces) 3.1 TB (3 controllers) bash-4.2$ dmg storage scan --verbose ------------ wolf-[71-72] ------------ SCM Namespace Socket ID Capacity ------------- --------- -------- pmem0 0 3.2 TB pmem1 1 3.2 TB NVMe PCI Model FW Revision Socket ID Capacity -------- ----- ----------- --------- -------- 0000:81:00.0 INTEL SSDPED1K750GA E2010325 1 750 GB 0000:87:00.0 INTEL SSDPEDMD016T4 8DV10171 1 1.6 TB 0000:da:00.0 INTEL SSDPED1K750GA E2010325 1 750 GB The NVMe PCI field above is what should be used in the server configuration file to identified NVMe SSDs.

The servers section of the yaml is a list specifying details for each DAOS I/O instance to be started on the host (currently a maximum of 2 per host is imposed). Devices with the same NUMA rating/node/socket should be colocated on a single DAOS I/O instance where possible. more details bdev_list should be populated with NVMe PCI addresses scm_list should be populated with PMem interleaved set namespaces (e.g. /dev/pmem1 ) DAOS Control Servers will need to be restarted on all hosts after updates to the server configuration file. Pick one host in the system and set access_points to list of that host's hostname or IP address (don't need to specify port). This will be the host which bootstraps the DAOS management service (MS). To illustrate, assume a cluster with homogeneous hardware configurations that returns the following from scan for each host: [daos@wolf-72 daos_m]$ dmg -l wolf-7[1-2] -i storage scan --verbose ------- wolf-7[1-2] ------- SCM Namespace Socket ID Capacity ------------- --------- -------- pmem0 0 2.90TB pmem1 1 2.90TB NVMe PCI Model FW Revision Socket ID Capacity -------- ----- ----------- --------- -------- 0000:81:00.0 INTEL SSDPED1K750GA E2010325 0 750.00GB 0000:87:00.0 INTEL SSDPEDMD016T4 8DV10171 0 1.56TB 0000:da:00.0 INTEL SSDPED1K750GA E2010325 1 750.00GB In this situation, the configuration file servers section could be populated as follows: <snip> port: 10001 access_points: [\"wolf-71\"] # <----- updated <snip> servers: - targets: 8 # number of I/O service threads per-engine first_core: 0 # offset of the first core for service threads nr_xs_helpers: 2 # count of I/O offload threads per target fabric_iface: eth0 # map to OFI_INTERFACE=eth0 fabric_iface_port: 31416 # map to OFI_PORT=31416 log_mask: ERR # map to D_LOG_MASK=ERR log_file: /tmp/server.log # map to D_LOG_FILE=/tmp/server.log env_vars: # influence DAOS I/O Engine behavior by setting env variables - DAOS_MD_CAP=1024 - CRT_CTX_SHARE_ADDR=0 - CRT_TIMEOUT=30 - FI_SOCKETS_MAX_CONN_RETRY=1 - FI_SOCKETS_CONN_TIMEOUT=2000 scm_mount: /mnt/daos # map to -s /mnt/daos scm_class: dcpm scm_list: [/dev/pmem0] # <----- updated bdev_class: nvme bdev_list: [\"0000:87:00.0\", \"0000:81:00.0\"] # <----- updated - targets: 8 # number of I/O service threads per-engine first_core: 0 # offset of the first core for service threads nr_xs_helpers: 2 # count of I/O offload threads per target fabric_iface: eth0 # map to OFI_INTERFACE=eth0 fabric_iface_port: 31416 # map to OFI_PORT=31416 log_mask: ERR # map to D_LOG_MASK=ERR log_file: /tmp/server.log # map to D_LOG_FILE=/tmp/server.log env_vars: # influence DAOS I/O Engine behavior by setting env variables - DAOS_MD_CAP=1024 - CRT_CTX_SHARE_ADDR=0 - CRT_TIMEOUT=30 - FI_SOCKETS_MAX_CONN_RETRY=1 - FI_SOCKETS_CONN_TIMEOUT=2000 scm_mount: /mnt/daos # map to -s /mnt/daos scm_class: dcpm scm_list: [/dev/pmem1] # <----- updated bdev_class: nvme bdev_list: [\"0000:da:00.0\"] # <----- updated <end> Network Scan and Configuration \u00b6 The daos_server supports the network scan function to display the network interfaces, related OFI fabric providers and associated NUMA node for each device. This information is used to configure the global fabric provider and the unique local network interface for each I/O Engine instance on this node. This section will help you determine what to provide for the provider , fabric_iface and pinned_numa_node entries in the daos_server.yml file. The following commands are typical examples: $ daos_server network scan $ daos_server network scan -p all $ daos_server network scan -p ofi+sockets $ daos_server network scan --provider 'ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm' In the early stages when a daos_server has not yet been fully configured and lacks a declaration of the system's fabric provider, it may be helpful to view an unfiltered list of scan results. Use either of these daos_server commands in the early stages to accomplish this goal: $ daos_server network scan $ daos_server network scan -p all Typical network scan results look as follows: $ daos_server network scan -p all --------- localhost --------- ------------- NUMA Socket 0 ------------- Provider Interfaces -------- ---------- ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm ib0 ofi+tcp;ofi_rxm ib0, eth0 ofi+verbs ib0 ofi+tcp ib0, eth0 ofi+sockets ib0, eth0 ofi+psm2 ib0 ------------- NUMA Socket 1 ------------- Provider Interfaces -------- ---------- ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm ib1 ofi+tcp;ofi_rxm ib1 ofi+verbs ib1 ofi+tcp ib1 ofi+sockets ib1 ofi+psm2 ib1 Use one of these providers to configure the provider in the daos_server.yml . Only one provider may be specified for the entire DAOS installation. Client nodes must be capable of communicating to the daos_server nodes via the same provider. Therefore, it is helpful to choose network settings for the daos_server that are compatible with the expected client node configuration. After the daos_server.yml file has been edited and contains a provider, subsequent daos_server network scan commands will filter the results based on that provider. If it is desired to view an unfiltered list again, issue daos_server network scan -p all . Regardless of the provider in the daos_server.yml file, the results may be filtered to the specified provider with the command daos_server network scan -p ofi_provider where ofi_provider is one of the available providers from the list. The results of the network scan may be used to help configure the I/O Engine instances for this DAOS Server. Each I/O Engine instance is configured with a unique fabric_iface and optional pinned_numa_node . The interfaces and NUMA Sockets listed in the scan results map to the daos_server.yml fabric_iface and pinned_numa_node respectively. The use of pinned_numa_node is optional, but recommended for best performance. When specified with the value that matches the network interface, the I/O Engine will bind itself to that NUMA node and to cores purely within that NUMA node. This configuration yields the fastest access to that network device. Changing Network Providers \u00b6 Information about the network configuration is stored as metadata on the DAOS storage. If, after initial deployment, the provider must be changed, it is necessary to reformat the storage devices using dmg storage format after the configuration file has been updated with the new provider. Network Scanning All DAOS Server Nodes \u00b6 While the daos_server network scan is useful for scanning the localhost, it does not provide results for any other daos_server instance on the network. The DAOS Management tool, dmg , is used for that purpose. The network scan operates the same way as the daos_server network scan, however, to use the dmg tool, at least one known daos_server instance must be running. The command dmg network scan performs a query over all daos_server s in the daos_control.yml hostlist . By default, the scan will return results that are filtered by the provider that is specified in the daos_server.yml . Like the daos_server network scan , the dmg network scan supports the optional -p/--provider where a different provider may be specified, or all for an unfiltered list that is unrelated to what was already configured on the daos_server installation. dmg network scan ------- wolf-29 ------- ------------- NUMA Socket 1 ------------- Provider Interfaces -------- ---------- ofi+sockets ib1 --------- localhost --------- ------------- NUMA Socket 0 ------------- Provider Interfaces -------- ---------- ofi+sockets ib0, eth0 ------------- NUMA Socket 1 ------------- Provider Interfaces -------- ---------- ofi+sockets ib1 Provider Configuration and Debug \u00b6 To aid in provider configuration and debug, it may be helpful to run the fi_pingpong test (delivered as part of OFI/libfabric). To run that test, determine the name of the provider to test usually by removing the \"ofi+\" prefix from the network scan provider data. Although the \"ofi+\" prefix is required in daos_server.yml , it cannot be used when specifying the provider for fi_pingpong . Then, the fi_pingpong test can be used to verify that the targeted OFI provider works fine: node1$ fi_pingpong -p psm2 node2$ fi_pingpong -p psm2 ${IP_ADDRESS_NODE1} bytes #sent #ack total time MB/sec usec/xfer Mxfers/sec 64 10 =10 1.2k 0.00s 21.69 2.95 0.34 256 10 =10 5k 0.00s 116.36 2.20 0.45 1k 10 =10 20k 0.00s 379.26 2.70 0.37 4k 10 =10 80k 0.00s 1077.89 3.80 0.26 64k 10 =10 1.2m 0.00s 2145.20 30.55 0.03 1m 10 =10 20m 0.00s 8867.45 118.25 0.01 Storage Formatting \u00b6 Once the daos_server has been restarted with the correct storage devices and network interface to use, one can move to the format phase. When daos_server is started for the first time, it enters \"maintenance mode\" and waits for a dmg storage format call to be issued from the management tool. This remote call will trigger the formatting of the locally attached storage on the host for use with DAOS using the parameters defined in the server config file. dmg -i -l <host>[,...] storage format will normally be run on a login node specifying a hostlist ( -l <host>[,...] ) of storage nodes with SCM/PMem modules and NVMe SSDs installed and prepared. Upon successful format, DAOS Control Servers will start DAOS IO instances that have been specified in the server config file. Successful start-up is indicated by the following on stdout: DAOS I/O Engine (v0.8.0) process 433456 started on rank 1 with 8 target, 2 helper XS per target, firstcore 0, host wolf-72.wolf.hpdd.intel.com. SCM Format \u00b6 When the command is run, the pmem kernel devices created on SCM/PMem regions are formatted and mounted based on the parameters provided in the server config file. scm_mount specifies the location of the mountpoint to create. scm_class can be set to ram to use a tmpfs in the situation that no SCM/PMem is available ( scm_size dictates the size of tmpfs in GB), when set to dcpm the device specified under scm_list will be mounted at scm_mount path. NVMe Format \u00b6 When the command is run, NVMe SSDs are formatted and set up to be used by DAOS based on the parameters provided in the server config file. bdev_class can be set to nvme to use actual NVMe devices with SPDK for DAOS storage. Other bdev_class values can be used for emulation of NVMe storage as specified in the server config file. bdev_list identifies devices to use with a list of PCI addresses (this can be populated after viewing results from storage scan command). After the format command is run, the path specified by the server configuration file scm_mount parameter should be mounted and should contain a file named daos_nvme.conf . The file should describe the devices with PCI addresses as listed in the bdev_list parameter of the server config file. The presence and contents of the file indicate that the specified NVMe SSDs have been configured correctly for use with DAOS. The contents of the NVMe SSDs listed in the server configuration file bdev_list parameter will be reset on format. Server Format \u00b6 Before the format command is run, no DAOS metadata should exist under the path specified by scm_mount parameter in the server configuration file. After the storage format command is run, the path specified by the server configuration file scm_mount parameter should be mounted and should contain the necessary DAOS metadata indicating that the server has been formatted. When starting, daos_server will skip maintenance mode and attempt to start I/O Engines if valid DAOS metadata is found in scm_mount . Agent Setup \u00b6 This section addresses how to configure the DAOS agents on the storage nodes before starting it. Agent Certificate Generation \u00b6 The DAOS security framework relies on certificates to authenticate administrators. The security infrastructure is currently under development and will be delivered in DAOS v1.0. Initial support for certificates has been added to DAOS and can be disabled either via the command line or in the DAOS Agent configuration file. Currently, the easiest way to disable certificate support is to pass the -i flag to daos_agent . Agent Configuration File \u00b6 The daos_agent configuration file is parsed when starting the daos_agent process. The configuration file location can be specified on the command line ( daos_agent -h for usage) or default location ( install/etc/daos_agent.yml ). If installed from rpms the default location is ( /etc/daos/daos_agent.yml ). Parameter descriptions are specified in daos_agent.yml . Any option supplied to daos_agent as a command line option or flag will take precedence over equivalent configuration file parameter. For convenience, active parsed config values are written to a temporary file for reference, and the location will be written to the log. The following section lists the format, options, defaults, and descriptions available in the configuration file. The example configuration file lists the default empty configuration listing all the options (living documentation of the config file). Live examples are available here . The location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the path specified through the -o option of the daos_agent command line, if not set then /etc/daos/daos_agent.yml is used. Refer to the example configuration file ( daos_agent.yml ) for latest information and examples. Agent Startup \u00b6 DAOS Agent is a standalone application to be run on each compute node. It can be configured to use secure communications (default) or can be allowed to communicate with the control plane over unencrypted channels. The following example shows daos_agent being configured to operate in insecure mode due to incomplete integration of certificate support as of the 0.6 release and configured to use a non-default agent configuration file. To start the DAOS Agent from the command line, run: $ daos_agent -i -o <'path to agent configuration file/daos_agent.yml'> & Alternatively, the DAOS Agent can be started as a systemd service. The DAOS Agent unit file is installed in the correct location when installing from RPMs. If you want to run the DAOS Agent without certificates (not recommended in production deployments), you need to add the -i option to the systemd ExecStart invocation (see below). If you wish to use systemd with a development build, you must copy the service file from utils/systemd to /usr/lib/systemd/system . Once the file is copied modify the ExecStart line to point to your in tree daos_agent binary. ExecStart=/usr/bin/daos_agent -i -o <'path to agent configuration file/daos_agent.yml'> Once the service file is installed, you can start daos_agent with the following commands: $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload $ sudo systemctl enable daos_agent.service $ sudo systemctl start daos_agent.service To check the component status use: $ sudo systemctl status daos_agent.service If DAOS Agent failed to start check the logs with: $ sudo journalctl --unit daos_agent.service Disable Agent Cache (Optional) \u00b6 In certain circumstances (e.g. for DAOS development or system evaluation), it may be desirable to disable the DAOS Agent's caching mechanism in order to avoid stale system information being retained across reformats of a system. The DAOS Agent normally caches a map of rank->fabric URI lookups as well as client network configuration data in order to reduce the number of management RPCs required to start an application. When this information becomes stale, the Agent must be restarted in order to repopulate the cache with new information. Alternatively, the caching mechanism may be disabled, with the tradeoff that each application launch will invoke management RPCs in order to obtain system connection information. To disable the DAOS Agent caching mechanism, set the following environment variable before starting the daos_agent process: DAOS_AGENT_DISABLE_CACHE=true If running from systemd, add the following to the daos_agent service file in the [Service] section before reloading systemd and restarting the daos_agent service: Environment=DAOS_AGENT_DISABLE_CACHE=true System Validation \u00b6 To validate that the DAOS system is properly installed, the daos_test suite can be executed. Ensure the DAOS Agent is configured before running daos_test . If the agent is using a non-default path for the socket, then configure DAOS_AGENT_DRPC_DIR in the client environment to point to this new location. DAOS automatically configures a client with a compatible fabric provider, network interface, network domain, CaRT timeout, and CaRT context share address, that will allow it to connect to the DAOS system. The client may not override the fabric provider or the CaRT context share address. A client application may override the three remaining settings by configuring environment variables in the client's shell prior to launch. To manually configure the CaRT timeout, set CRT_TIMEOUT such as: export CRT_TIMEOUT=5 To manually configure the network interface, set OFI_INTERFACE such as: export OFI_INTERFACE=lo When manually configuring an Infiniband device with a verbs provider, the network device domain is required. To manually configure the domain, set OFI_DOMAIN such as: export OFI_DOMAIN=hfi1_0 Launch the client application \u00b6 mpirun -np <num_clients> --hostfile <hostfile> ./daos_test daos_test requires at least 8GB of SCM (or DRAM with tmpfs) storage on each storage node. https://github.com/intel/ipmctl \u21a9 https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/utils/config \u21a9 https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#mpirun-hostfile \u21a9 https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/src/control/README.md \u21a9 https://github.com/pmem/ndctl/issues/130 \u21a9","title":"System Deployment"},{"location":"admin/deployment/#system-deployment","text":"The DAOS deployment workflow requires to start the DAOS server instances early on to enable administrators to perform remote operations in parallel across multiple storage nodes via the dmg management utility.

After daos_server instances have been started on each storage node for the first time, daos_server storage prepare --scm-only will set PMem storage into the necessary state for use with DAOS when run on each host.

Config file output will not be generated in the following cases: - PMem device count, capacity or NUMA mappings differ on any of the hosts in the hostlist (the hostlist can be specified either in the 'dmg' config file or on the commandline). - NVMe SSD count, PCI address distribution or NUMA affinity differs on any of the hosts in the host list. - NUMA node count can't be detected on the hosts or differs on any host in the host list. - PMem device count or NUMA affinity doesn't meet the 'num-engines' requirement. - NVMe device count or NUMA affinity doesn't meet the 'min-ssds' requirement. - network device count or NUMA affinity doesn't match the configured PMem devices, taking into account any specified network device class preference (ethernet or infiniband). Some CentOS 7.x kernels from before the 7.9 release were known to have a defect that prevented ndctl from being able to report the NUMA affinity for a namespace.

A set of certificates for a given DAOS system may be generated by running the gen_certificates.sh script provided with the DAOS software if there is not an existing TLS certificate infrastructure. The gen_certificates.sh script uses the openssl tool to generate all of the necessary files. We highly recommend using OpenSSL Version 1.1.1h or higher as keys and certificates generated with earlier versions are vulnerable to attack. When DAOS is installed from RPMs, this script is provided in the base daos RPM, and may be invoked in the directory to which the certificates will be written.

Instructions for other types of SCM may be covered in the future. Provisioning the SCM occurs by configuring PMem modules in interleaved memory regions (interleaved mode) in groups of modules local to a specific socket (NUMA), and resultant nvdimm namespaces are defined by a device identifier (e.g., /dev/pmem0). PMem preparation is required once per DAOS installation. This step requires a reboot to enable PMem resource allocation changes to be read by BIOS. PMem preparation can be performed with daos_server storage prepare --scm-only . The first time the command is run, the SCM interleaved regions will be created as resource allocations on any available PMem modules (one region per NUMA node/socket). The regions are activated after BIOS reads the new resource allocations. Upon completion, the storage prepare command will prompt the admin to reboot the storage node(s) in order for the BIOS to activate the new storage allocations. The storage prepare command does not initiate the reboot itself. After running the command a reboot will be required, the command will then need to be run for a second time to expose the namespace device to be used by DAOS. Example usage: clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] daos_server storage prepare --scm-only after running, the user should be prompted for a reboot. clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] reboot clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] daos_server storage prepare --scm-only after running, PMem devices (/dev/pmemX namespaces created on the new SCM regions) should be available on each of the hosts. On the second run, one namespace per region is created, and each namespace may take up to a few minutes to create. Details of the pmem devices will be displayed in JSON format on command completion. Upon successful creation of the pmem devices, the Intel(R) Optane(TM) persistent memory is configured and one can move on to the next step. If required, the pmem devices can be destroyed with the command daos_server storage prepare --scm-only --reset . All namespaces are disabled and destroyed. The SCM regions are removed by resetting modules into \"MemoryMode\" through resource allocations. Note that undefined behavior may result if the namespaces/pmem kernel devices are mounted before running reset (as per the printed warning).

Only one provider may be specified for the entire DAOS installation. Client nodes must be capable of communicating to the daos_server nodes via the same provider. Therefore, it is helpful to choose network settings for the daos_server that are compatible with the expected client node configuration. After the daos_server.yml file has been edited and contains a provider, subsequent daos_server network scan commands will filter the results based on that provider. If it is desired to view an unfiltered list again, issue daos_server network scan -p all . Regardless of the provider in the daos_server.yml file, the results may be filtered to the specified provider with the command daos_server network scan -p ofi_provider where ofi_provider is one of the available providers from the list. The results of the network scan may be used to help configure the I/O Engine instances for this DAOS Server. Each I/O Engine instance is configured with a unique fabric_iface and optional pinned_numa_node . The interfaces and NUMA Sockets listed in the scan results map to the daos_server.yml fabric_iface and pinned_numa_node respectively. The use of pinned_numa_node is optional, but recommended for best performance.

The DAOS Agent normally caches a map of rank->fabric URI lookups as well as client network configuration data in order to reduce the number of management RPCs required to start an application. When this information becomes stale, the Agent must be restarted in order to repopulate the cache with new information. Alternatively, the caching mechanism may be disabled, with the tradeoff that each application launch will invoke management RPCs in order to obtain system connection information. To disable the DAOS Agent caching mechanism, set the following environment variable before starting the daos_agent process: DAOS_AGENT_DISABLE_CACHE=true If running from systemd, add the following to the daos_agent service file in the [Service] section before reloading systemd and restarting the daos_agent service: Environment=DAOS_AGENT_DISABLE_CACHE=true","title":"Disable Agent Cache (Optional)"},{"location":"admin/deployment/#system-validation","text":"To validate that the DAOS system is properly installed, the daos_test suite can be executed.

D_LOG_MASK Used to specify what type/level of logging will be present for either all of the registered subsystems or a select few. Options in decreasing priority level order: FATAL, CRIT, ERR, WARN, NOTE, INFO, DEBUG. DEBUG option is used to enable all logging (debug messages as well as all higher priority level messages).

Deployment Options \u00b6 As illustrated in the figure below, a DAOS storage system can be deployed in two different ways: Pooled Storage Model : The DAOS servers can run on dedicated storage nodes in separate racks. This is a traditional pool model where storage is uniformly accessed by all compute nodes. In order to minimize the number of I/O racks and to optimize floor space, this approach usually requires high-density storage servers. Hyper-converged Storage Model : In this model, the storage nodes are integrated into compute racks and can be either dedicated or shared nodes. The DAOS servers are thus massively distributed, and storage access is non-uniform and must take locality into account. This model is common in hyper-converged infrastructure. While DAOS is mostly deployed following the pooled model, active research is conducted to efficiently support the hyper-converged model as well. Processor Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires a 64-bit processor architecture and is primarily developed on Intel x86_64 architecture. The DAOS software and the libraries it depends on (e.g., ISA-L, SPDK, PMDK, and DPDK) can take advantage of Intel SSE and AVX extensions. DAOS is also regularly tested on 64-bit ARM processors configured in Little Endian mode. The same build instructions that are used for x86_64 are applicable for ARM builds as well. DAOS and its dependencies will make the necessary adjustments automatically in their respective build systems for ARM platforms. Network Requirements \u00b6 The DAOS network layer relies on libfabrics and supports OFI providers for Ethernet/sockets, InfiniBand/verbs, RoCE, and Intel Omni-Path Architecture (OPA). An RDMA-capable fabric is preferred for better performance. DAOS can support multiple rails by binding different instances of the DAOS server to individual network cards. The DAOS control plane provides methods for administering and managing the DAOS servers using a secure socket layer interface. An additional out-of-band network connecting the nodes in the DAOS service cluster is required for DAOS administration. Management traffic between clients and servers uses IP over Fabric. Storage Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires each storage node to have direct access to storage-class memory (SCM). While DAOS is primarily tested and tuned for Optane DC Persistent Memory, the DAOS software stack is built over the Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) and the DAX feature of the Linux and Windows operating systems as described in the SNIA NVM Programming Model 1 . As a result, the open-source DAOS software stack should be able to run transparently over any storage-class memory supported by the PMDK. The storage node can optionally be equipped with NVMe (non-volatile memory express) SSDs to provide capacity. HDDs, as well as SATA and SAS SSDs, are not supported by DAOS. Both NVMe 3D-NAND and Optane SSDs are supported. Optane SSDs are preferred for DAOS installation that targets a very high IOPS rate. NVMe-oF devices are also supported by the userspace storage stack but have never been tested. A minimum 6% ratio of SCM to SSD capacity will guarantee that DAOS has enough space in SCM to store its internal metadata (e.g., pool metadata, SSD block allocation tracking). For testing purposes, SCM can be emulated with DRAM by mounting a tmpfs filesystem, and NVMe SSDs can be also emulated with DRAM or a loopback file. Storage Server Design \u00b6 The hardware design of a DAOS storage server balances the network bandwidth of the fabric with the aggregate storage bandwidth of the NVMe storage devices. This relationship sets the number of NVMe drives. For example, 8 PCIe gen4 x4 NVMe SSDs balance two 200Gbps PCIe gen4 x16 network adapters. The capacity of the SSDs will determine the minimum capacity of the Optane PMem DIMMs needed to provide the 6% ratio for DAOS metadata. CPU Affinity \u00b6 Recent Intel Xeon data center platforms use two processor CPUs connected together with the Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI). PCIe lanes in these servers have a natural affinity to one CPU. Although globally accessible from any of the system cores, NVMe SSDs and network interface cards connected through the PCIe bus may provide different performance characteristics (e.g., higher latency, lower bandwidth) to each CPU. Accessing non-local PCIe devices may involve traffic over the UPI link that might become a point of congestion. Similarly, persistent memory is non-uniformly accessible (NUMA), and CPU affinity must be respected for maximal performance. Therefore, when running in a multi-socket and multi-rail environment, the DAOS service must be able to detect the CPU to PCIe device and persistent memory affinity and minimize as much as possible non-local access. This can be achieved by spawning one instance of the I/O Engine per CPU, then accessing only the persistent memory and PCI devices local to that CPU from that server instance. The DAOS control plane is responsible for detecting the storage and network affinity and starting the I/O Engines accordingly. Fault Domains \u00b6 DAOS relies on single-ported storage massively distributed across different storage nodes. Each storage node is thus a single point of failure. DAOS achieves fault tolerance by providing data redundancy across storage nodes in different fault domains. DAOS assumes that fault domains are hierarchical and do not overlap. For instance, the first level of a fault domain could be the racks and the second one, the storage nodes. For efficient placement and optimal data resilience, more fault domains are better. As a result, it is preferable to distribute storage nodes across as many racks as possible. https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/ technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf \u21a9","title":"Hardware Requirements"},{"location":"admin/hardware/#hardware-requirements","text":"The purpose of this section is to describe processor, storage, and network requirements to deploy a DAOS system.","title":"Hardware Requirements"},{"location":"admin/hardware/#deployment-options","text":"As illustrated in the figure below, a DAOS storage system can be deployed in two different ways: Pooled Storage Model : The DAOS servers can run on dedicated storage nodes in separate racks.

Distribution Packages \u00b6 DAOS packages are available for CentOS7 and openSUSE Leap 15. For other distribution, manual building is required (see next section). CentOS 7.9 \u00b6 Configure the DAOS package repository as follows: $ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/daos-packages.repo http://packages.daos.io/v1.2/CentOS7/packages/x86_64/daos_packages.repo epel-release is required for both client and server: $ sudo yum install -y epel-release To install the DAOS client packages: $ sudo yum install -y daos-client To install the DAOS server packages: $ sudo yum install -y daos-server Debug and source RPMs available in the respective debug and source repositories. openSUSE Leap 15 \u00b6 Add the DAOS package repository via zypper: $ sudo zypper ar http://packages.daos.io/v1.2/Leap15/packages/x86_64/ daos_packages $ sudo rpm --import http://packages.daos.io/RPM-GPG-KEY $ sudo zypper --non-interactive ref To install the DAOS client packages: $ sudo zypper install -y daos-client To install the DAOS server packages: $ sudo zypper install -y daos-server Debug and source RPMs available in the respective debug and source repositories. DAOS from Scratch \u00b6 The following instructions have been verified with CentOS. Installations on other Linux distributions might be similar with some variations. Developers of DAOS may want to review the additional sections below before beginning, for suggestions related specifically to development. Contact us in our forum for further help with any issues. Build Prerequisites \u00b6 To build DAOS and its dependencies, several software packages must be installed on the system. This includes scons, libuuid, cmocka, ipmctl, and several other packages usually available on all the Linux distributions. Moreover, a Go version of at least 1.10 is required. An exhaustive list of packages for each supported Linux distribution is maintained in the Docker files (please click on the link): CentOS 7 openSUSE Leap 15 Ubuntu 20.04 The command lines to install the required packages can be extracted from the Docker files by removing the \"RUN\" command, which is specific to Docker. Check the utils/docker directory for different Linux distribution versions. Some DAOS tests use MPI. The DAOS build process uses the environment modules package to detect the presence of MPI. If none is found, the build will skip building those tests. DAOS Source Code \u00b6 The DAOS repository is hosted on GitHub . To checkout the latest 1.2 version, simply run: $ git clone --recurse-submodules -b release/1.2 https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git This command clones the DAOS git repository (path referred as ${daospath} below) and initializes all the submodules automatically. Building DAOS & Dependencies \u00b6 If all the software dependencies listed previously are already satisfied, then type the following command in the top source directory to build the DAOS stack: $ scons --config=force install If you are a developer of DAOS, we recommend following the instructions in the DAOS for Development section. Otherwise, the missing dependencies can be built automatically by invoking scons with the following parameters: $ scons --config=force --build-deps=yes install By default, DAOS and its dependencies are installed under ${daospath}/install. The installation path can be modified by adding the PREFIX= option to the above command line (e.g., PREFIX=/usr/local). Note Several parameters can be set (e.g., COMPILER=clang or COMPILER=icc) on the scons command line. Please see scons --help for all the possible options. Those options are also saved for future compilations. Environment setup \u00b6 Once built, the environment must be modified to search for binaries and header files in the installation path. This step is not required if standard locations (e.g. /bin, /sbin, /usr/lib, ...) are used. CPATH=${daospath}/install/include/:$CPATH PATH=${daospath}/install/bin/:${daospath}/install/sbin:$PATH export CPATH PATH If using bash, PATH can be set up for you after a build by sourcing the script utils/sl/utils/setup_local.sh from the daos root. This script utilizes a file generated by the build to determine the location of daos and its dependencies. If required, ${daospath}/install must be replaced with the alternative path specified through PREFIX. DAOS in Docker \u00b6 This section describes how to build and run the DAOS service in a Docker container. A minimum of 5GB of DRAM and 16GB of disk space will be required. On Mac, please make sure that the Docker settings under \"Preferences/{Disk, Memory}\" are configured accordingly. Building a Docker Image \u00b6 To build the Docker image directly from GitHub, run the following command: $ docker build https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git#release/1.2 \\ -f utils/docker/Dockerfile.centos.7 -t daos or from a local tree: $ docker build . -f utils/docker/Dockerfile.centos.7 -t daos This creates a CentOS 7 image, fetches the latest DAOS version from GitHub, builds it, and installs it in the image. For Ubuntu and other Linux distributions, replace Dockerfile.centos.7 with Dockerfile.ubuntu.20.04 and the appropriate version of interest. Simple Docker Setup \u00b6 Once the image created, one can start a container that will eventually run the DAOS service: $ docker run -it -d --privileged --cap-add=ALL --name server -v /dev:/dev daos Note If you want to be more selective with the devices that are exported to the container, individual devices should be listed and exported as volume via the -v option. In this case, the hugepages devices should also be added to the command line via -v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages and -v /dev/hugepages-1G:/dev/hugepages-1G Warning If Docker is being run on a non-Linux system (e.g., OSX), -v /dev:/dev should be removed from the command line. The daos_server_local.yml configuration file sets up a simple local DAOS system with a single server instance running in the container. By default, it uses 4GB of DRAM to emulate persistent memory and 16GB of bulk storage under /tmp. The storage size can be changed in the yaml file if necessary. The DAOS service can be started in the docker container as follows: $ docker exec server daos_server start \\ -o /home/daos/daos/utils/config/examples/daos_server_local.yml Note Please make sure that the uio_pci_generic module is loaded on the host. Once started, the DAOS server waits for the administrator to format the system. This can be triggered in a different shell, using the following command: $ docker exec server dmg -i storage format Upon successful completion of the format, the storage engine is started, and pools can be created using the daos admin tool (see next section).

Network Performance \u00b6 The DAOS CaRT layer can validate and benchmark network communications in the same context as an application and using the same networks/tuning options as regular DAOS. The CaRT self_test can run against the DAOS servers in a production environment in a non-destructive manner. CaRT self_test supports different message sizes, bulk transfers, multiple targets, and the following test scenarios: Selftest client to servers - where self_test issues RPCs directly to a list of servers. Cross-servers - where self_test sends instructions to the different servers that will issue cross-server RPCs. This model supports a many to many communication model. Building CaRT self_test \u00b6 The CaRT self_test and its tests are delivered as part of the daos_client and daos_tests distribution packages . It can also be built from scratch. $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git $ cd daos $ scons --build-deps=yes install $ cd install For detailed information, please refer to the DAOS build documentation section. Running CaRT self_test \u00b6 Instructions to run CaRT self_test are as follows. Start DAOS server self_test requires DAOS server to be running before attempt running self_test . For detailed instruction on how to start DAOS server, please refer to the server startup documentation. Dump system attachinfo self_test will use the address information in daos_server.attach_info_tmp file. To create such file, run the following command: ./bin/daos_agent dump-attachinfo -o ./daos_server.attach_info_tmp Prepare hostfile The list of nodes from which self_test will run can be specified in a hostfile (referred to as ${hostfile}). Hostfile used here is the same as the ones used by OpenMPI. For additional details, please refer to the mpirun documentation . Run CaRT self_test The example below uses an Ethernet interface and Sockets provider. In the self_test commands: Selftest client to servers - Replace the argument for --endpoint accordingly. Cross-servers - Replace the argument for --endpoint and --master-endpoint accordingly.

Benchmarking DAOS \u00b6 DAOS can be benchmarked using several widely used IO benchmarks like IOR, mdtest, and FIO. There are several backends that can be used with those benchmarks. ior \u00b6 IOR ( https://github.com/hpc/ior ) with the following backends: The IOR APIs POSIX, MPIIO and HDF5 can be used with DAOS POSIX containers that are accessed over dfuse. This works without or with the I/O interception library ( libioil ). Performance is significantly better when using libioil . A custom DFS (DAOS File System) plugin for DAOS can be used by building IOR with DAOS support, and selecting API=DFS. This integrates IOR directly with the DAOS File System ( libdfs ), without requiring FUSE or an interception library. When using the IOR API=MPIIO, the ROMIO ADIO driver for DAOS can be used by providing the daos:// prefix to the filename. This ADIO driver bypasses dfuse and directly invkes the libdfs calls to perform I/O to a DAOS POSIX container. The DAOS-enabled MPIIO driver is available in the upstream MPICH repository (MPICH 3.4.1 or higher). An HDF5 VOL connector for DAOS is under development. This maps the HDF5 data model directly to the DAOS data model, and works in conjunction with DAOS containers of --type=HDF5 (in contrast to DAOS container of --type=POSIX that are used for the other IOR APIs). mdtest \u00b6 mdtest is released in the same repository as IOR. The corresponding backends that are listed above support mdtest, except for the MPI-IO and HDF5 backends that were only designed to support IOR. FIO \u00b6 A DAOS engine is integrated into FIO and available upstream. To build it, just run: $ git clone http://git.kernel.dk/fio.git $ cd fio $ ./configure $ make install If DAOS is installed via packages, it should be automatically detected. If not, please specific the path to the DAOS library and headers to configure as follows: $ CFLAGS=\"-I/path/to/daos/install/include\" LDFLAGS=\"-L/path/to/daos/install/lib64\" ./configure Once successfully build, once can run the default example: $ export POOL= # your pool UUID $ export CONT= # your container UUID $ fio ./examples/dfs.fio Please note that DAOS does not transfer data (i.e. zeros) over the network when reading a hole in a sparse POSIX file. Very high read bandwidth can thus be reported if fio reads unallocated extents in a file. It is thus a good practice to start fio with a first write phase. FIO can also be used to benchmark DAOS performance using dfuse and the interception library with all the POSIX based engines like sync and libaio. daos_perf \u00b6 Finally, DAOS provides a tool called daos_perf which allows benchmarking to the DAOS object API directly or to the internal VOS API, which bypasses the client and network stack and reports performance accessing the storage directly using VOS. For a full description of daos_perf usage, run: $ daos_perf --help Client Performance Tuning \u00b6 For best performance, a DAOS client should specifically bind itself to a NUMA node instead of leaving core allocation and memory binding to chance. This allows the DAOS Agent to detect the client's NUMA affinity from its PID and automatically assign a network interface with a matching NUMA node. The network interface provided in the GetAttachInfo response is used to initialize CaRT. To override the automatically assigned interface, the client should set the environment variable OFI_INTERFACE to match the desired network interface. The DAOS Agent scans the client machine on the first GetAttachInfo request to determine the set of network interfaces available that support the DAOS Server's OFI provider. This request occurs as part of the initialization sequence in the libdaos daos_init() performed by each client. Upon receipt, the Agent populates a cache of responses indexed by NUMA affinity. Provided a client application has bound itself to a specific NUMA node and that NUMA node has a network device associated with it, the DAOS Agent will provide a GetAttachInfo response with a network interface corresponding to the client's NUMA node. When more than one appropriate network interface exists per NUMA node, the agent uses a round-robin resource allocation scheme to load balance the responses for that NUMA node. If a client is bound to a NUMA node that has no matching network interface, then a default NUMA node is used for the purpose of selecting a response. Provided that the DAOS Agent can detect any valid network device on any NUMA node, the default response will contain a valid network interface for the client. When a default response is provided, a message in the Agent's log is emitted: No network devices bound to client NUMA node X. Using response from NUMA Y To improve performance, it is worth figuring out if the client bound itself to the wrong NUMA node, or if expected network devices for that NUMA node are missing from the Agent's fabric scan. In some situations, the Agent may detect no network devices and the response cache will be empty. In such a situation, the GetAttachInfo response will contain no interface assignment and the following info message will be found in the Agent's log: No network devices detected in fabric scan; default AttachInfo response may be incorrect In either situation, the admin may execute the command daos_agent net-scan with appropriate debug flags to gain more insight into the configuration problem. Disabling the GetAttachInfo cache: The default configuration enables the Agent GetAttachInfo cache. If it is desired, the cache may be disabled prior to DAOS Agent startup by setting the Agent's environment variable DAOS_AGENT_DISABLE_CACHE=true . The cache is loaded only at Agent startup. The following debug message will be found in the Agent's log: GetAttachInfo agent caching has been disabled If the network configuration changes while the Agent is running, it must be restarted to gain visibility to these changes.

While those pool properties are currently stored persistently with pool metadata, many of them are still under development. Moreover, the ability to modify some of those properties on an existing pool will be provided in a future release. Modifying DAOS_PROP_PO_RECLAIM property \u00b6 To modify a pool's DAOS_PO_RECLAIM property: $ dmg pool set-prop --pool=<UUID> --name=reclaim --value=${strategy} Three reclaim strategies are supported: \"disabled\" : Never trigger aggregation. \"lazy\" : Trigger aggregation only when there is no IO activities or SCM free space is under pressure (default strategy) \"time\" : Trigger aggregation regularly despite of IO activities. Querying a pool's properties \u00b6 The user-level administration daos utility may be used to query a pool's properties. Refer to the manual page for full daos usage details. $ daos pool get-prop --pool=b1e9f5c0-ce10-42ab-b19e-081032400611 Pool properties for b1e9f5c0-ce10-42ab-b19e-081032400611 : label: pool label not set rebuild space ratio: 0% self-healing: auto-exclude,auto-rebuild reclaim strategy: lazy owner: username@ owner-group: username@ Access Control List: # # (remainder of output not shown) # Additionally, a pool's properties may be retrieved using the libdaos API daos_pool_query() function. Refer to the file src/include/daos_pool.h Doxygen comments and the online documentation available here . Access Control Lists \u00b6 Client user and group access for pools are controlled by Access Control Lists (ACLs) . Most pool-related tasks are performed using the DMG administrative tool, which is authenticated by the administrative certificate rather than user-specific credentials. Access-controlled client pool accesses include: Connecting to the pool. Querying the pool. Creating containers in the pool. Deleting containers in the pool. This is reflected in the set of supported pool permissions . A user must be able to connect to the pool in order to access any containers inside, regardless of their permissions on those containers. Ownership \u00b6 Pool ownership conveys no special privileges for access control decisions. All desired privileges of the owner-user ( OWNER@ ) and owner-group ( GROUP@ ) must be explicitly defined by an administrator in the pool ACL. Creating a pool with a custom ACL \u00b6 To create a pool with a custom ACL: $ dmg pool create --size <size> --acl-file <path> The ACL file format is detailed in the here . Displaying a Pool's ACL \u00b6 To view a pool's ACL: $ dmg pool get-acl --pool <UUID> The output is in the same string format used in the ACL file during creation, with one Access Control Entry (i.e., ACE) per line. Modifying a Pool's ACL \u00b6 For all of these commands using an ACL file, the ACL file must be in the format noted above for pool creation. Overwriting the ACL \u00b6 To replace a pool's ACL with a new ACL: $ dmg pool overwrite-acl --pool <UUID> --acl-file <path> Adding and Updating ACEs \u00b6 To add or update multiple entries in an existing pool ACL: $ dmg pool update-acl --pool <UUID> --acl-file <path> To add or update a single entry in an existing pool ACL: $ dmg pool update-acl --pool <UUID> --entry <ACE> If there is no existing entry for the principal in the ACL, the new entry is added to the ACL. If there is already an entry for the principal, that entry is replaced with the new one. Removing an ACE \u00b6 To delete an entry for a given principal in an existing pool ACL: $ dmg pool delete-acl --pool <UUID> --principal <principal> The principal corresponds to the principal portion of an ACE that was set during pool creation or a previous pool ACL operation. For the delete operation, the principal argument must be formatted as follows: Named user: u:username@ Named group: g:groupname@ Special principals: OWNER@ , GROUP@ , and EVERYONE@ The entry for that principal will be completely removed. This does not always mean that the principal will have no access. Rather, their access to the pool will be decided based on the remaining ACL rules. Pool Query \u00b6 The pool query operation retrieves information (i.e., the number of targets, space usage, rebuild status, property list, and more) about a created pool. It is integrated into the dmg utility. To query a pool: $ dmg pool query --pool <UUID> Below is the output for a pool created with SCM space only. pool=47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a Pool 47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a, ntarget=64, disabled=8 Pool space info: - Target(VOS) count:56 - SCM: Total size: 28GB Free: 28GB, min:505MB, max:512MB, mean:512MB - NVMe: Total size: 0 Free: 0, min:0, max:0, mean:0 Rebuild done, 10 objs, 1026 recs The total and free sizes are the sum across all the targets whereas min/max/mean gives information about individual targets. A min value close to 0 means that one target is running out of space. NB: the Versioning Object Store (VOS) may reserve a portion of the SCM and NVMe allocations to mitigate fragmentation and for background operations (e.g., aggregation, garbage collection). The amount of storage set aside depends on the size of the target, and may take up 2+ GB. Therefore, out of space conditions may occur even while pool query may not reveal min approaching zero. The example below shows a rebuild in progress and NVMe space allocated. pool=95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671 Pool 95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671, ntarget=64, disabled=8 Pool space info: - Target(VOS) count:56 - SCM: Total size: 28GB Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB - NVMe: Total size: 56GB Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB Rebuild busy, 75 objs, 9722 recs Additional status and telemetry data are planned to be exported through management tools and will be documented here once available. Pool Modifications \u00b6 Target Exclusion and Self-Healing \u00b6 Pool Exclude \u00b6 An operator can exclude one or more targets from a specific DAOS pool using the rank the target resides on as well as the target idx on that rank. If a target idx list is not provided then all targets on the rank will be excluded. Excluding a target will automatically start the rebuild process. To exclude a target from a pool: $ dmg pool exclude --pool=${puuid} --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3} The pool target exclude command accepts 3 parameters: The pool UUID of the pool that the targets will be excluded from. The rank of the target(s) to be excluded. The target Indices of the targets to be excluded from that rank (optional). Pool Drain \u00b6 Alternatively when an operator would like to remove one or more pool targets without the system operating in degraded mode Drain can be used. A pool drain operation will initiate rebuild without excluding the designated target until after the rebuild is complete. This allows the target(s) drained to continue to perform I/O while the rebuild operation is ongoing. Drain additionally enables non-replicated data to be rebuilt onto another target whereas in a conventional failure scenario non-replicated data would not be integrated into a rebuild and would be lost. To drain a target from a pool: $ dmg pool drain --pool=${puuid} --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3} The pool target drain command accepts 3 parameters: The pool UUID of the pool that the targets will be drained from. The rank of the target(s) to be drained. The target Indices of the targets to be drained from that rank (optional). Target Reintegration \u00b6 After a target failure an operator can fix the underlying issue and reintegrate the affected targets to restore the pool to its original state. The operator can either reintegrate specific targets for a rank by supplying a target idx list, or reintegrate an entire rank by omitting the list. $ dmg pool reintegrate --pool=${puuid} --rank=${rank} --target-idx=${idx1},${idx2},${idx3} The pool reintegrate command accepts 3 parameters: The pool UUID of the pool that the targets will be reintegrated into. The rank of the affected targets. The target Indices of the targets to be reintegrated on that rank (optional). When rebuild is triggered it will list the operations and their related targets by their rank ID and target index. Target (rank 5 idx 0) is down. Target (rank 5 idx 1) is down. ... (rank 5 idx 0) is excluded. (rank 5 idx 1) is excluded. These should be the same values used when reintegrating the targets. $ dmg pool reintegrate --pool=${puuid} --rank=5 --target-idx=0,1 Pool Extension \u00b6 Target Addition & Space Rebalancing \u00b6 Full Support for online target addition and automatic space rebalancing is planned for a future release and will be documented here once available. Until then the following command(s) are placeholders and offer limited functionality related to Online Server Addition/Rebalancing operations. An operator can choose to extend a pool to include ranks not currently in the pool. This will automatically trigger a server rebalance operation where objects within the extended pool will be rebalanced across the new storage. $ dmg pool extend --pool=${puuid} --ranks=${rank1},${rank2}... The pool extend command accepts 2 required parameters: The pool UUID of the pool to be extended. A comma separated list of server ranks to include in the pool. The pool rebalance operation will work most efficiently when the pool is extended to its desired size in a single operation, as opposed to multiple, small extensions. Pool Shard Resize \u00b6 Support for quiescent pool shard resize is currently not supported and is under consideration. Pool Catastrophic Recovery \u00b6 A DAOS pool is instantiated on each target by a set of pmemobj files managed by PMDK and SPDK blobs on SSDs. Tools to verify and repair this persistent data is scheduled for DAOS v2.4 and will be documented here once available. Meanwhile, PMDK provides a recovery tool (i.e., pmempool check) to verify and possibly repair a pmemobj file. As discussed in the previous section, the rebuild status can be consulted via the pool query and will be expanded with more information. Recovering Ownership of a Pool's Container \u00b6 Typically users are expected to manage their containers. However, in the event that a container is orphaned and no users have the privileges to change the ownership, an administrator can transfer ownership of the container to a new user and/or group. To change the owner user: $ dmg cont set-owner --pool <UUID> --cont <UUID> --user <owner-user> To change the owner group: $ dmg cont set-owner --pool <UUID> --cont <UUID> --group <owner-group> The user and group names are case sensitive and must be formatted as DAOS ACL user/group principals . Because this is an administrative action, it does not require the administrator to have any privileges assigned in the container ACL.","title":"Pool Operations"},{"location":"admin/pool_operations/#pool-operations","text":"A DAOS pool is a storage reservation that can span any storage nodes and is managed by the administrator.

Exact details depend on the distribution, but the following example should be illustrative: # Enable IOMMU on CentOS 7 # All commands must be run as root/sudo! $ sudo vi /etc/default/grub # add the following line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"intel_iommu=on\" # after saving the file, run the following to reconfigure # the bootloader: $ sudo grub2-mkconfig --output=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg # if the command completed with no errors, reboot the system # in order to make the changes take effect $ sudo reboot Warning VFIO support is a new feature for DAOS 1.2 and has been tested on CentOS 7.7 To force SPDK to use UIO rather than VFIO at daos_server runtime, set 'disable_vfio' in the server config file , but note that this will require running daos_server as root. Time Synchronization \u00b6 The DAOS transaction model relies on timestamps and requires time to be synchronized across all the storage and client nodes. This can be done using NTP or any other equivalent protocol. User/Group Synchronization \u00b6 DAOS ACLs store the actual user and group names (instead of numeric IDs), and therefore the servers do not need access to a synchronized user/group database. The DAOS Agent (running on the client nodes) is responsible for resolving UID/GID to user/group names which are added to a signed credential and sent to the DAOS storage nodes. Multi-rail/NIC Setup \u00b6 Storage nodes can be configured with multiple network interfaces to run multiple engine instances. Subnet \u00b6 Since all DAOS engines need to be able to communicate, the different network interfaces need to be on the same subnet or routing capabilities across the different subnet might be configured. Infiniband/RoCE \u00b6 Some special configuration is required to use librdmacm with multiple interfaces. Firstly, the accept_local feature must be enabled on the network interfaces to be used by DAOS. This can be done using the following command ( must be replaced with the interface names): $ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_local=1 Secondly, Linux must be configured to only send ARP replies on the interface targeted in the ARP request. This is configured via the arp_ignore parameter. This should be set to 2 if all the IPoIB interfaces on the client and storage nodes are in the same logical subnet (e.g. ib0 == 10.0.0.27, ib1 == 10.0.1.27, prefix=16). $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore=2 If separate logical subnets are used (e.g. prefix = 24), then the value must be set to 1. $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore=1 Finally, the rp_filter is set to 1 by default on several distributions (e.g. on CentOS 7) and should be set to either 0 or 2, with 2 being more secure. This is true even if the configuration uses a single logical subnet. $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.<ifaces>.rp_filter=2 All those parameters can be made persistent in /etc/sysctl.conf by adding a new sysctl file under /etc/sysctl.d (e.g. /etc/sysctl.d/95-daos-net.conf) with all the relevant settings. For more information, please refer to the librdmacm documentation Runtime Directory Setup \u00b6 DAOS uses a series of Unix Domain Sockets to communicate between its various components. On modern Linux systems, Unix Domain Sockets are typically stored under /run or /var/run (usually a symlink to /run) and are a mounted tmpfs file system. There are several methods for ensuring the necessary directories are setup. A sign that this step may have been missed is when starting daos_server or daos_agent, you may see the message: $ mkdir /var/run/daos_server: permission denied Unable to create socket directory: /var/run/daos_server Non-default Directory \u00b6 By default, daos_server and daos_agent will use the directories /var/run/daos_server and /var/run/daos_agent respectively. To change the default location that daos_server uses for its runtime directory, either uncomment and set the socket_dir configuration value in install/etc/daos_server.yml, or pass the location to daos_server on the command line using the -d flag. For the daos_agent, an alternate location can be passed on the command line using the --runtime_dir flag. Default Directory (non-persistent) \u00b6 Files and directories created in /run and /var/run only survive until the next reboot. However, if reboots are infrequent, an easy solution while still utilizing the default locations is to create the required directories manually. To do this execute the following commands. daos_server: $ mkdir /var/run/daos_server $ chmod 0755 /var/run/daos_server $ chown user:user /var/run/daos_server (where user is the user you will run daos_server as) daos_agent: $ mkdir /var/run/daos_agent $ chmod 0755 /var/run/daos_agent $ chown user:user /var/run/daos_agent (where user is the user you will run daos_agent as) Default Directory (persistent) \u00b6 If the server hosting daos_server or daos_agent will be rebooted often, systemd provides a persistent mechanism for creating the required directories called tmpfiles.d. This mechanism will be required every time the system is provisioned and requires a reboot to take effect. To tell systemd to create the necessary directories for DAOS: Copy the file utils/systemd/daosfiles.conf to /etc/tmpfiles.d\\ cp utils/systemd/daosfiles.conf /etc/tmpfiles.d Modify the copied file to change the user and group fields (currently daos) to the user daos will be run as Reboot the system, and the directories will be created automatically on all subsequent reboots. Elevated Privileges \u00b6 DAOS employs a privileged helper binary ( daos_admin ) to perform tasks that require elevated privileges on behalf of daos_server . Privileged Helper Configuration \u00b6 When DAOS is installed from RPM, the daos_admin helper is automatically installed to the correct location with the correct permissions. The RPM creates a \"daos_server\" system group and configures permissions such that daos_admin may only be invoked from daos_server . For non-RPM installations, there are two supported scenarios: daos_server is run as root, which means that daos_admin is also invoked as root, and therefore no additional setup is necessary. daos_server is run as a non-root user, which means that daos_admin must be manually installed and configured. The steps to enable the second scenario are as follows (steps are assumed to be running out of a DAOS source tree which may be on a NFS share): $ chmod -x $daospath/bin/daos_admin # prevent this copy from being executed $ sudo cp $daospath/bin/daos_admin /usr/bin/daos_admin $ sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/daos_admin # make this copy setuid root $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/daos/control # create symlinks to SPDK scripts $ sudo ln -sf $daospath/share/daos/control/setup_spdk.sh \\ /usr/share/daos/control $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/spdk/scripts $ sudo ln -sf $daospath/share/spdk/scripts/setup.sh \\ /usr/share/spdk/scripts $ sudo ln -sf $daospath/share/spdk/scripts/common.sh \\ /usr/share/spdk/scripts $ sudo ln -s $daospath/include \\ /usr/share/spdk/include Note The RPM installation is preferred for production scenarios. Manual installation is most appropriate for development and predeployment proof-of-concept scenarios. Memory Lock Limits \u00b6 Low ulimit for memlock can cause SPDK to fail and emit the following error: daos_engine:1 EAL: cannot set up DMA remapping, error 12 (Cannot allocate memory) The memlock limit only needs to be manually adjusted when daos_server is not running as a systemd service. Default ulimit settings vary between OSes. For RPM installations, the service will typically be launched by systemd and the limit is pre-set to unlimited in the daos_server.service unit file: https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/master/utils/systemd/daos_server.service#L16. Note that values set in /etc/security/limits.conf are ignored by services launched by systemd. For non-RPM installations where daos_server is launched directly from the commandline, limits should be adjusted in /etc/security/limits.conf as per https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/blogs/best-known-methods-for-setting-locked-memory-size.html.","title":"Pre-deployment Checklist"},{"location":"admin/predeployment_check/#pre-deployment-checklist","text":"This section covers the preliminary setup required on the compute and storage nodes before deploying DAOS.","title":"Pre-deployment Checklist"},{"location":"admin/predeployment_check/#enable-iommu-optional","text":"In order to run the DAOS server as a non-root user with NVMe devices, the hardware must support virtualized device access, and it must be enabled in the system BIOS.

The function d_errstr() is provided in the API to convert an error number to an error message. Log Files \u00b6 On the server side, there are three log files created as part of normal server operations: Component Config Parameter Example Config Value Control Plane control_log_file /tmp/daos_server.log Data Plane log_file /tmp/daos_engine.*.log Privileged Helper helper_log_file /tmp/daos_admin.log agent log_file /tmp/daos_agent.log Control Plane Log \u00b6 The default log level for the control plane is INFO. The following levels may be set using the control_log_mask config parameter: DEBUG INFO ERROR Data Plane Log \u00b6 Data Plane ( daos_engine ) logging is configured on a per-instance basis. In other words, each section under the servers: section must have its own logging configuration. The log_file config parameter is converted to a D_LOG_FILE environment variable value. For more detail, please see the Debugging System section of this document. Privileged Helper Log \u00b6 By default, the privileged helper only emits ERROR-level logging which is captured by the control plane and included in that log. If the helper_log_file parameter is set in the server config, then DEBUG-level logging will be sent to the specified file. Daos Agent Log \u00b6 If the log_file config parameter is set in the agent config, then DEBUG-level logging will be sent to the specified file. Debugging System \u00b6 DAOS uses the debug system defined in CaRT , specifically the GURT library. Both server and client default log is stdout , unless otherwise set by D_LOG_FILE environment variable (client) or log_file config parameter (server). Registered Subsystems/Facilities \u00b6 The debug logging system includes a series of subsystems or facilities which define groups for related log messages (defined per source file). There are common facilities which are defined in GURT, as well as other facilities that can be defined on a per-project basis (such as those for CaRT and DAOS). DD_SUBSYS can be used to set which subsystems to enable logging. By default all subsystems are enabled (\"DD_SUBSYS=all\"). DAOS Facilities: common, tree, vos, client, server, rdb, pool, container, object, placement, rebuild, tier, mgmt, bio, tests Common Facilities (GURT): MISC, MEM CaRT Facilities: RPC, BULK, CORPC, GRP, LM, HG, ST, IV Priority Logging \u00b6 All macros that output logs have a priority level, shown in descending order below. D_FATAL(fmt, ...) FATAL D_CRIT(fmt, ...) CRIT D_ERROR(fmt, ...) ERR D_WARN(fmt, ...) WARN D_NOTE(fmt, ...) NOTE D_INFO(fmt, ...) INFO D_DEBUG(mask, fmt, ...) DEBUG The priority level that outputs to stderr is set with DD_STDERR. By default in DAOS (specific to the project), this is set to CRIT (\"DD_STDERR=CRIT\") meaning that all CRIT and more severe log messages will dump to stderr. However, this is separate from the priority of logging to \"/tmp/daos.log\". The priority level of logging can be set with D_LOG_MASK, which by default is set to INFO (\"D_LOG_MASK=INFO\"), which will result in all messages excluding DEBUG messages being logged. D_LOG_MASK can also be used to specify the level of logging on a per-subsystem basis as well (\"D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG,MEM=ERR\"). Debug Masks/Streams: \u00b6 DEBUG messages account for a majority of the log messages, and finer-granularity might be desired. Mask bits are set as the first argument passed in D_DEBUG(mask, ...). To accomplish this, DD_MASK can be set to enable different debug streams. Similar to facilities, there are common debug streams defined in GURT, as well as other streams that can be defined on a per-project basis (CaRT and DAOS). All debug streams are enabled by default (\"DD_MASK=all\"). DAOS Debug Masks: md = metadata operations pl = placement operations mgmt = pool management epc = epoch system df = durable format rebuild = rebuild process daos_default = (group mask) io, md, pl, and rebuild operations Common Debug Masks (GURT): any = generic messages, no classification trace = function trace, tree/hash/lru operations mem = memory operations net = network operations io = object I/Otest = test programs Common Use Cases \u00b6 Generic setup for all messages (default settings) $ D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG $ DD_SUBSYS=all $ DD_MASK=all Disable all logs for performance tuning $ D_LOG_MASK=ERR -> will only log error messages from all facilities $ D_LOG_MASK=FATAL -> will only log system fatal messages Disable a noisy debug logging subsystem $ D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG,MEM=ERR -> disables MEM facility by restricting all logs from that facility to ERROR or higher priority only Enable a subset of facilities of interest $ DD_SUBSYS=rpc,tests $ D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG -> required to see logs for RPC and TESTS less severe than INFO (the majority of log messages) Fine-tune the debug messages by setting a debug mask $ D_LOG_MASK=DEBUG $ DD_MASK=mgmt -> only logs DEBUG messages related to pool management Refer to the DAOS Environment Variables document for more information about the debug system environment. Common DAOS Problems \u00b6 When DER_AGENT_INCOMPAT is received, it means that the client library libdaos.so is likely mismatched with the DAOS Agent. The libdaos.so, DAOS Agent and DAOS Server must be built from compatible sources so that the GetAttachInfo protocol is the same between each component.

An invitation to join the slack workspace is automatically sent when joining the community mailing list. Coding Rules \u00b6 Please check the coding conventions for code contribution. Commit Comments \u00b6 Commit Message Content \u00b6 Writing good commit comments is critical to ensuring that changes are easily understood, even years after they were originally written. The commit comment should contain enough information about the change to allow the reader to understand the motivation for the change, what parts of the code it is affecting, and any interesting, unusual, or complex parts of the change to draw attention to. The reason for a change may be manyfold: bug, enhancement, feature, code style, etc. so providing information about this sets the stage for understanding the change. If it is a bug, include information about what usage triggers the bug and how it manifests (error messages, assertion failure, etc.). If it is a feature, include information about what improvement is being made, and how it will affect usage. Providing some high-level information about the code path that is being modified is useful for the reader, since the files and patch fragments are not necessarily going to be listed in a sensible order in the patch. Including the important functions being modified provides a starting point for the reader to follow the logic of the change, and makes it easier to search for such changes in the future. If the patch is based on some earlier patch, then including the git commit hash of the original patch, Jira ticket number, etc. is useful for tracking the chain of dependencies. This can be very useful if a patch is landed separately to different maintenance branches, if it is fixing a problem in a previously landed patch, or if it is being imported from an upstream kernel commit. Having long commit comments that describe the change well is a good thing. The commit comments will be tightly associated with the code for a long time into the future, even many of the original commit comments from years earlier are still available through changes of the source code repository. In contrast, bug tracking systems come and go, and cannot be relied upon to track information about a change for extended periods of time. Commit Message Format \u00b6 Unlike the content of the commit message, the format is relatively easy to verify for correctness. Having the same standard format allows Git tools like git shortlog to extract information from the patches more easily. The first line of the commit comment is the commit summary of the change. Changes submitted to the DAOS master branch require a DAOS Jira ticket number at the beginning of the commit summary. A DAOS Jira ticket is one that begins with DAOS and is, therefore, part of the DAOS project within Jira. The commit summary should also have a component: tag immediately following the Jira ticket number that indicates to which DAOS subsystem the commit is related. Example DAOS subsystems relate to modules like client, pool, container, object, vos, rdb; functional components like rebuild; or auxiliary components like build, tests, doc. This subsystem list is not exhaustive but provides a good guideline for consistency. The commit summary line must be 62 characters or less, including the Jira ticket number and component tag, so that git shortlog and git format-patch can fit the summary onto a single line. The summary must be followed by a blank line. The rest of the comments should be wrapped to 70 columns or less. This allows for the first line to be used as a subject in emails, and also for the entire body to be displayed using tools like git log or git shortlog in an 80 column window. DAOS-nnn component: short description of change under 62 columns The \"component:\" should be a lower-case single-word subsystem of the DAOS code that best encompasses the change being made. Examples of components include modules: client, pool, container, object, vos, rdb, cart; functional subsystems: recovery; and auxiliary areas: build, tests, docs. This list is not exhaustive, but is a guideline. The commit comment should contain a detailed explanation of changes being made. This can be as long as you'd like. Please give details of what problem was solved (including error messages or problems that were seen), a good high-level description of how it was solved, and which parts of the code were changed (including important functions that were changed, if this is useful to understand the patch, and for easier searching).

The -s option to git commit also adds the Signed-off-by: line automatically. Additional commit tags \u00b6 A number of additional commit tags can be used to further explain who has contributed to the patch, and for tracking purposes. These tags are commonly used with Linux kernel patches. These tags should appear before the Signed-off-by: tag.

This includes how to regenerate the protobuf files or add new Go package dependencies, which is only required for development purposes. Building DAOS for Development \u00b6 The DAOS repository is hosted on GitHub . To checkout the current development version, simply run: $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git For a specific branch or tag (e.g. v1.2), add -b v1.2 to the command line above. Prerequisite when built using --build-deps are installed in component specific directories under PREFIX/prereq/$TARGET_TYPE. Run the following scons command: $ scons PREFIX=${daos_prefix_path} install --build-deps=yes --config=force Installing the components into separate directories allow upgrading the components individually by replacing --build-deps=yes with --update-prereq={component\\_name} . This requires a change to the environment configuration from before. For automated environment setup, source utils/sl/utils/setup_local.sh . The install path should be relocatable with the exception that daos_admin will not be able to find the new location of daos and dependencies. All other libraries and binaries should work without any change due to relative paths. Editing the .build-vars.sh file to replace the old with the new can restore the capability of setup_local.sh to automate path setup. To run daos_server, either the rpath in daos_admin needs to be patched to the new installation location of spdk and isal or LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set. This can be done using SL_SPDK_PREFIX and SL_ISAL_PREFIX set when sourcing setup_local.sh . This can also be done with the following commands: source utils/sl/setup_local.sh sudo -E utils/setup_daos_admin.sh [path to new location of daos] This script is intended only for developer setup of daos_admin . With this approach, DAOS gets built using the prebuilt dependencies in ${daos_prefix_path}/prereq , and required options are saved for future compilations. So, after the first time, during development, only \" scons --config=force \" and \" scons --config=force install \" would suffice for compiling changes to DAOS source code. If you wish to compile DAOS with clang rather than gcc , set COMPILER=clang on the scons command line. This option is also saved for future compilations. Additionally, users can specify BUILD_TYPE=[dev|release|debug] and scons will save the intermediate build for the various BUILD_TYPE , COMPILER , and TARGET_TYPE options so a user can switch between options without a full rebuild and thus with minimal cost. By default, TARGET_TYPE is set to 'default' which means it uses the BUILD_TYPE setting. To avoid rebuilding prerequisites for every BUILD_TYPE setting, TARGET_TYPE can be explicitly set to a BUILD_TYPE setting to always use that set of prerequisites. These settings are stored in daos.conf so setting the values on subsequent builds is not necessary. If needed, ALT_PREFIX can be set to a colon separated prefix path where to look for already built components. If set, the build will check these paths for components before proceeding to build. Go dependencies \u00b6 Developers contributing Go code may need to change the external dependencies located in the src/control/vendor directory. The DAOS codebase uses Go Modules to manage these dependencies. As this feature is built in to Go distributions starting with version 1.11, no additional tools are needed to manage dependencies. Among other benefits, one of the major advantages of using Go Modules is that it removes the requirement for builds to be done within the $GOPATH , which simplifies our build system and other internal tooling. While it is possible to use Go Modules without checking a vendor directory into SCM, the DAOS project continues to use vendored dependencies in order to insulate our build system from transient network issues and other problems associated with nonvendored builds. The following is a short list of example workflows. For more details, please refer to one of the many resources available online. # add a new dependency $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go get github.com/awesome/thing # make sure that github.com/awesome/thing is imported somewhere in the codebase $ ./run_go_tests.sh # note that go.mod and go.sum have been updated automatically # # when ready to commit and push for review: $ go mod vendor $ git commit -a # should pick up go.mod, go.sum, vendor/*, etc. # update an existing dependency $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go get -u github.com/awesome/thing # make sure that github.com/awesome/thing is imported somewhere in the codebase $ ./run_go_tests.sh # note that go.mod and go.sum have been updated automatically # # when ready to commit and push for review: $ go mod vendor $ git commit -a # should pick up go.mod, go.sum, vendor/*, etc. # replace/remove an existing dependency $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go get github.com/other/thing # make sure that github.com/other/thing is imported somewhere in the codebase, # and that github.com/awesome/thing is no longer imported $ ./run_go_tests.sh # note that go.mod and go.sum have been updated automatically # # when ready to commit and push for review: $ go mod tidy $ go mod vendor $ git commit -a # should pick up go.mod, go.sum, vendor/*, etc. In all cases, after updating the vendor directory, it is a good idea to verify that your changes were applied as expected. In order to do this, a simple workflow is to clear the caches to force a clean build and then run the test script, which is vendor-aware and will not try to download missing modules: $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go clean -modcache -cache $ ./run_go_tests.sh $ ls ~/go/pkg/mod # ~/go/pkg/mod should either not exist or be empty Protobuf Compiler \u00b6 The DAOS control plane infrastructure uses Protocol Buffers as the data serialization format for its RPC requests. Not all developers will need to compile the \\*.proto files, but if Protobuf changes are needed, the developer must regenerate the corresponding C and Go source files using a Protobuf compiler compatible with proto3 syntax. Recommended Versions \u00b6 The recommended installation method is to clone the git repositories, check out the tagged releases noted below, and install from source. Later versions may work, but are not guaranteed. You may encounter installation errors when building from source relating to insufficient permissions. If that occurs, you may try relocating the repo to /var/tmp/ in order to build and install from there. Protocol Buffers v3.11.4. Installation instructions . Protobuf-C v1.3.3. Installation instructions . gRPC plugin: protoc-gen-go is the version specified in go.mod . This plugin is automatically installed by the Makefile in $DAOSREPO/src/proto. Compiling Protobuf Files \u00b6 The source ( .proto ) files live under $DAOSREPO/src/proto . The preferred mechanism for generating compiled C/Go protobuf definitions is to use the Makefile in this directory. Care should be taken to keep the Makefile updated when source files are added or removed, or generated file destinations are updated. Note that the generated files are checked into SCM and are not generated as part of the normal DAOS build process. This allows developers to ensure that the generated files are correct after any changes to the source files are made. $ cd ~/daos/src/proto # or wherever your daos clone lives $ make protoc -I /home/foo/daos/src/proto/mgmt/ --go_out=plugins=grpc:/home/foo/daos/src/control/common/proto/mgmt/ acl.proto protoc -I /home/foo/daos/src/proto/mgmt/ --go_out=plugins=grpc:/home/foo/daos/src/control/common/proto/mgmt/ mgmt.proto ... $ git status ... # modified: ../control/common/proto/mgmt/acl.pb.go # modified: ../control/common/proto/mgmt/mgmt.pb.go ... After verifying that the generated C/Go files are correct, add and commit them as you would any other file.","title":"Dev Environment"},{"location":"dev/development/#development-environment","text":"This section covers specific instructions to create a developer-friendly environment to contribute to the DAOS development.

These settings are stored in daos.conf so setting the values on subsequent builds is not necessary. If needed, ALT_PREFIX can be set to a colon separated prefix path where to look for already built components. If set, the build will check these paths for components before proceeding to build.","title":"Building DAOS for Development"},{"location":"dev/development/#go-dependencies","text":"Developers contributing Go code may need to change the external dependencies located in the src/control/vendor directory. The DAOS codebase uses Go Modules to manage these dependencies. As this feature is built in to Go distributions starting with version 1.11, no additional tools are needed to manage dependencies. Among other benefits, one of the major advantages of using Go Modules is that it removes the requirement for builds to be done within the $GOPATH , which simplifies our build system and other internal tooling. While it is possible to use Go Modules without checking a vendor directory into SCM, the DAOS project continues to use vendored dependencies in order to insulate our build system from transient network issues and other problems associated with nonvendored builds. The following is a short list of example workflows. For more details, please refer to one of the many resources available online. # add a new dependency $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go get github.com/awesome/thing # make sure that github.com/awesome/thing is imported somewhere in the codebase $ ./run_go_tests.sh # note that go.mod and go.sum have been updated automatically # # when ready to commit and push for review: $ go mod vendor $ git commit -a # should pick up go.mod, go.sum, vendor/*, etc. # update an existing dependency $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go get -u github.com/awesome/thing # make sure that github.com/awesome/thing is imported somewhere in the codebase $ ./run_go_tests.sh # note that go.mod and go.sum have been updated automatically # # when ready to commit and push for review: $ go mod vendor $ git commit -a # should pick up go.mod, go.sum, vendor/*, etc. # replace/remove an existing dependency $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go get github.com/other/thing # make sure that github.com/other/thing is imported somewhere in the codebase, # and that github.com/awesome/thing is no longer imported $ ./run_go_tests.sh # note that go.mod and go.sum have been updated automatically # # when ready to commit and push for review: $ go mod tidy $ go mod vendor $ git commit -a # should pick up go.mod, go.sum, vendor/*, etc. In all cases, after updating the vendor directory, it is a good idea to verify that your changes were applied as expected. In order to do this, a simple workflow is to clear the caches to force a clean build and then run the test script, which is vendor-aware and will not try to download missing modules: $ cd ~/daos/src/control # or wherever your daos clone lives $ go clean -modcache -cache $ ./run_go_tests.sh $ ls ~/go/pkg/mod # ~/go/pkg/mod should either not exist or be empty","title":"Go dependencies"},{"location":"dev/development/#protobuf-compiler","text":"The DAOS control plane infrastructure uses Protocol Buffers as the data serialization format for its RPC requests.

Unlike the traditional storage stacks that were primarily designed for rotating media, DAOS is architected from the ground up to exploit new NVM technologies and is extremely lightweight since it operates End-to-End (E2E) in user space with full OS bypass. DAOS offers a shift away from an I/O model designed for block-based and high-latency storage to one that inherently supports fine-grained data access and unlocks the performance of the next-generation storage technologies. Unlike traditional Burst Buffers, DAOS is a high-performant independent and fault-tolerant storage tier that does not rely on a third-party tier to manage metadata and data resilience. DAOS Features \u00b6 DAOS relies on OFI for low-latency communications and stores data on both storage-class memory (SCM) and NVMe storage. DAOS presents a native key-array-value storage interface that offers a unified storage model over which domain-specific data models are ported, such as HDF5, MPI-IO, and Apache Arrow. A POSIX I/O emulation layer implementing files and directories over the native DAOS API is also available. DAOS I/O operations are logged and then inserted into a persistent index maintained in SCM. Each I/O is tagged with a particular timestamp called epoch and is associated with a particular version of the dataset. No read-modify-write operations are performed internally. Write operations are non-destructive and not sensitive to alignment. Upon read request, the DAOS service walks through the persistent index and creates a complex scatter-gather Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) descriptor to reconstruct the data at the requested version directly in the buffer provided by the application. The SCM storage is memory-mapped directly into the address space of the DAOS service that manages the persistent index via direct load/store. Depending on the I/O characteristics, the DAOS service can decide to store the I/O in either SCM or NVMe storage. As represented in Figure 2-1, latency-sensitive I/Os, like application metadata and byte-granular data, will typically be stored in the former, whereas checkpoints and bulk data will be stored in the latter. This approach allows DAOS to deliver the raw NVMe bandwidth for bulk data by streaming the data to NVMe storage and maintaining internal metadata index in SCM. The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) allows managing transactional access to SCM and the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) enables user-space I/O to NVMe devices. Figure 2-1.

A DAOS installation involves several components that can be either collocated or distributed. A DAOS system is identified by a system name, and consists of a set of DAOS storage nodes connected to the same network. The DAOS storage nodes run one DAOS server instance per node, which in turn starts one DAOS Engine process per physical socket. Membership of the DAOS servers is recorded into the system map, that assigns a unique integer rank to each Engine process. Two different DAOS systems comprise two disjoint sets of DAOS servers, and do not coordinate with each other. The DAOS server is a multi-tenant daemon running on a Linux instance (either natively on the physical node or in a VM or container) of each storage node . Its Engine sub-processes export the locally-attached SCM and NVM storage through the network. It listens to a management port (addressed by an IP address and a TCP port number), plus one or more fabric endpoints (addressed by network URIs). The DAOS server is configured through a YAML file in /etc/daos, including the configuration of its Engine sub-processes. The DAOS server startup can be integrated with different daemon management or orchestration frameworks (for example a systemd script, a Kubernetes service, or even via a parallel launcher like pdsh or srun). Inside a DAOS Engine, the storage is statically partitioned across multiple targets to optimize concurrency. To avoid contention, each target has its private storage, its own pool of service threads, and its dedicated network context that can be directly addressed over the fabric independently of the other targets hosted on the same storage node. The SCM modules are typically configured in AppDirect interleaved mode. They are thus presented to the operating system as a single PMEM namespace per socket (in fsdax mode). When N targets per engine are configured, each target is using 1/N of the capacity of the fsdax SCM capacity of that socket, independently of the other targets. Each target is also using a fraction of the NVMe capacity of the NVMe drives that are attached to this socket. A target does not implement any internal data protection mechanism against storage media failure. As a result, a target is a single point of failure and the unit of fault. A dynamic state is associated with each target: Its state can be either \"up and running\", or \"down and not available\". A target is the unit of performance. Hardware components associated with the target, such as the backend storage medium, the CPU core(s), and the network, have limited capability and capacity. The number of targets exported by a DAOS Engine instance is configurable, and depends on the underlying hardware (in particular, the number of SCM modules and the number of NVMe SSDs that are served by this engine instance). As a best practice, the number of targets of an engine should be an integer multiple of the number of NVMe drives that are served by this engine. SDK and Tools \u00b6 Applications, users, and administrators can interact with a DAOS system through two different client APIs. The management API offers the ability to administrate a DAOS system. It is intended to be integrated with different vendor-specific storage management or open-source orchestration frameworks. The dmg CLI tool is built over the DAOS management API. On the other hand, the DAOS library ( libdaos ) implements the DAOS storage model. It is primarily targeted at application and I/O middleware developers who want to store datasets in a DAOS system. User utilities like the daos command are also built over the API to allow users to manage datasets from a CLI. Applications can access datasets stored in DAOS either directly through the native DAOS API, through an I/O middleware library (e.g. POSIX emulation, MPI-IO, HDF5) or through frameworks like Spark or TensorFlow that have already been integrated with the native DAOS storage model. Agent \u00b6 The DAOS agent is a daemon residing on the client nodes that interacts with the DAOS library to authenticate the application processes. It is a trusted entity that can sign the DAOS library credentials using certificates. The agent can support different authentication frameworks, and uses a Unix Domain Socket to communicate with the DAOS library.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"overview/architecture/#architecture","text":"DAOS is an open-source software-defined scale-out object store that provides high bandwidth and high IOPS storage containers to applications and enables next-generation data-centric workflows combining simulation, data analytics, and machine learning.

While each component in the system (network layer, storage devices) may offer protection against silent data corruption, DAOS provides end-to-end data integrity using checksums to better ensure that user data is not corrupted silently. For DAOS, end-to-end means that the client will calculate and verify checksums, providing protection for data through the entire I/O stack. During a write or update, the DAOS Client library (libdaos.so) calculates a checksum and appends it to the RPC message before transferred over the network. Depending on the configuration, the DAOS Server may or may not calculate checksums to verify the data on receipt. On a fetch, the DAOS Server will send a known good checksum with the requested data to the DAOS Client, which will calculate checksums on the data received and verify. Requirements \u00b6 Key Requirements \u00b6 There are two key requirements that DAOS will support. 1. Detect silent data corruption - Corruption will be detected on the distribution and attribute keys and records within a DAOS object. At a minimum, when corruption is detected, an error will be reported. 1. Correct data corruption - When data corruption is detected, an attempt will be made to recover the data using data redundancy mechanisms. Supportive/Additional Requirements \u00b6 Additionally, DAOS will support ... 1. End to End Data Integrity as a Quality of Service Attribute - Container properties are used to enable/disable the use of checksums for data integrity as well as define specific attributes of data integrity feature. See https://daos-stack.github.io/user/container/#data-integrity for details on configuring a container with checksums enabled. 1. Minimize Performance Impact - When there is no data corruption, the End to End Data Integrity feature should have minimal performance impacted. If data corruption is detected, performance can be impacted to correct the data. Work is ongoing to minimize performance impact. 1. Inject Errors - The ability to corrupt data within a specific record, key, or checksum will be necessary for testing purposes. Fault injection is used to simulate corruption over the network and on disk. The DAOS_CSUM_CORRUPT_* flags used for data corruption are defined in src/include/daos/common.h. 1. Logging - When data corruption is detected, error logs are captured in the client and server logs. Up coming features not supported yet 1. Event Logging - When silent data corruption is discovered, an event should be logged in such a way that it can be retrieved with other system health and diagnostic information. 1. Proactive background service task - A background task on the server which scans for and detects (audits checksums) silent data corruption and corrects. Keys and Value Objects \u00b6 Because DAOS is a key/value store, the data for both keys and values is protected, however, the approach for both is slightly different. For the two different value types, single and array, the approach is also slightly different. Keys \u00b6 On an update and fetch, the client calculates a checksum for the data used as the distribution and attribute keys and will send it to the server within the RPC. The server verifies the keys with the checksum. While enumerating keys, the server will calculate checksums for the keys and pack within the RPC message to the client. The client will verify the keys received. Note Checksums for keys are not stored on the server. A hash of the key is calculated and used to index the key in the server tree of the keys (see VOS Key Array Stores ). It is also expected that keys are stored only in Storage Class Memory which has reliable data integrity protection. Values \u00b6 On an update, the client will calculate a checksum for the data of the value and will send it to the server within the RPC. If \"server verify\" is enabled, the server will calculate a new checksum for the value and compare with the checksum received from the client to verify the integrity of the value. If the checksums don't match, then data corruption has occurred and an error is returned to the client indicating that the client should try the update again. Whether \"server verify\" is enabled or not, the server will store the checksum. See VOS for more info about checksum management and storage in VOS. On a fetch, the server will return the stored checksum to the client with the values fetched so the client can verify the values received. If the checksums don't match, then the client will fetch from another replica if available in an attempt to get uncorrupted data. There are some slight variations to this approach for the two different types of values. The following diagram illustrates a basic example. (See Storage Model for more details about the single value and array value types) Single Value \u00b6 A Single Value is an atomic value, meaning that writes to a single value will update the entire value and reads retrieve the entire value. Other DAOS features such as Erasure Codes might split a Single Value into multiple shards to be distributed among multiple storage nodes. Either the whole Single Value (if going to a single node) or each shard (if distributed) will have a checksum calculated, sent to the server, and stored on the server. Note that it is possible for a single value, or shard of a single value, to be smaller than the checksum derived from it. It is advised that if an application needs many small single values to use an Array Type instead. Array Values \u00b6 Unlike Single Values, Array Values can be updated and fetched at any part of an array. In addition, updates to an array are versioned, so a fetch can include parts from multiple versions of the array. Each of these versioned parts of an array are called extents. The following diagrams illustrate a couple examples (also see VOS Key Array Stores for more information): A single extent update (blue line) from index 2-13. A fetched extent (orange line) from index 2-6. The fetch is only part of the original extent written. ![](../graph/data_integrity/array_example_1.png) Many extent updates and different epochs. A fetch from index 2-13 requires parts from each extent. ![Array Example 2](../graph/data_integrity/array_example_2.png) The nature of the array type requires that a more sophisticated approach to creating checksums is used. DAOS uses a \"chunking\" approach where each extent will be broken up into \"chunks\" with a predetermined \"chunk size.\" Checksums will be derived from these chunks. Chunks are aligned with an absolute offset (starting at 0), not an I/O offset. The following diagram illustrates a chunk size configured to be 4 (units is arbitrary in this example). Though not all chunks have a full size of 4, an absolute offset alignment is maintained. The gray boxes around the extents represent the chunks. (See Object Layer for more details about the checksum process on object update and fetch) Checksum calculations \u00b6 The actual checksum calculations are done by the isa-l and isa-l_crypto libraries. However, these libraries are abstracted away from much of DAOS and a common checksum library is used with appropriate adapters to the actual isa-l implementations. common checksum library Performance Impact \u00b6 Calculating checksums can be CPU intensive and will impact performance. To mitigate performance impact, checksum types with hardware acceleration should be chosen. For example, CRC32C is supported by recent Intel CPUs, and many are accelerated via SIMD. Quality \u00b6 Unit and functional testing is performed at many layers.

If memory is allocated for the iov, then the daos client will pack the checksums into the it. If insufficient memory is allocated in the buffer, the iov_len will be set to the required capacity and the checksums packed into the buffer is truncated. Client Task API Touch Points \u00b6 dc_obj_fetch_task_create : sets csum iov to daos_obj_fetch_t args. These args are set to the rw_cb_args.shard_args.api_args and accessed through an accessor function (rw_args2csum_iov) in cli_shard.c so that rw_args_store_csum can easily access it. This function, called from dc_rw_cb_csum_verify, will pack the data checksums received from the server into the iov. dc_obj_list_obj_task_create : sets csum iov to daos_obj_list_obj_t args. args.csum is then copied to obj_enum_args.csum in dc_obj_shard_list(). On enum callback (dc_enumerate_cb()) the packed csum buffer is copied from the rpc args to obj_enum_args.csum (which points to the same buffer as the caller's) Rebuild Touch Points \u00b6 migrate_fetch_update_(inline|single|bulk) - the rebuild/migrate functions that write to vos locally must ensure that the checksum is also written. These must use the csum iov param for fetch to get the checksum, then unpack the csums into iod_csum. obj_enum.c is relied on for enumerating the objects to be rebuilt. Because the fetch_update functions will unpack the csums from fetch, it will also unpack the csums for enum, so the unpacking process in obj_enum.c will simply copy the csum_iov to the io (dss_enum_unpack_io) structure in enum_unpack_recxs() and then deep copy to the mrone (migrate_one) structure in migrate_one_insert() . Packing/unpacking checksums \u00b6 When checksums are packed (either for fetch or object list) only the data checksums are included. For object list, only checksums for data that is inlined is included. During a rebuild, if the data is not inlined, then the rebuild process will fetch the rest of the data and also get the checksums. ci_serialize() - \"packs\" checksums by appending the struct to an iov and then appending the checksum info buffer to the iov. This puts the actual checksum just after the checksum structure that describes the checksum. ci_cast() - \"unpacks\" the checksum and describing structure. It does this by casting an iov's buffer to a dcs_csum_info struct and setting the csum_info's checksum pointer to point to the memory just after the structure. It does not copy anything, but really just \"casts\". To get all dcs_csum_infos, a caller would cast the iov, copy the csum_info to a destination, then move to the next csum_info(ci_move_next_iov) in the iov. Because this process modifies the iov structure it is best to use a copy of the iov as a temp structure. VOS \u00b6 akey_update_begin - determines how much extra space needs to be allocated in SCM to account for the checksum Arrays \u00b6 evt_root_activate - evtree root is activated. If has a csum them the root csum properties are set (csum_len, csum_type, csum_chunk_size) evt_desc_csum_fill - if root was activated with a punched record then it won't have had the csum fields set correctly so set them here. Main purpose is to copy the csum to the end of persistent evt record (evt_desc). Enough SCM should have been reserved in akey_update_begin. evt_entry_csum_fill - Copy the csum from the persistent memory to the evt_entry returned. Also copy the csum fields from the evtree root to complete the csum_info structure in the evt_entry. akey_fetch_recx - checksums are saved to the ioc for each found extent.

Aggregation \u00b6 srv_csum_recalc.c - the checksum verification and calculations occur here Checksum Scrubbing (In Development) \u00b6 A background task will scan (when the storage server is idle to limit performance impact) the Version Object Store (VOS) trees to verify the data integrity with the checksums. Corrective actions can be taken when corruption is detected. See Corrective Actions Scanner \u00b6 Goals/Requirements \u00b6 Detect Silent Data Corruption Proactively - The whole point of the scrubber is to detect silent data corruption before it is fetched. Minimize CPU and I/O Bandwidth - Checksum scrubbing scanner will impact CPU and the I/O bandwidth because it must iterate the VOS tree (I/O to SCM) fetch data (I/O to SSD) and calculate checksums (CPU intensive). To minimize both of these impacts, the server scheduler must be able to throttled the scrubber's I/O and CPU usage. Minimize Media Wear - The background task will minimize media wear by preventing objects from being scrubbed too frequently. A container config/tunable will be used by an operator to define the minimum number of days that should pass before an object is scanned again. Continuous - The background task will be a continuous processes instead of running on a schedule. Once complete immediately start over. Throttling approaches should prevent from scrubbing same objects too frequently. High Level Design \u00b6 Per Pool ULT (I/O xstream) that will iterate containers. If checksums and scrubber is enabled then iterate the object tree. If a record value (SV or array) is not marked corrupted then scan. Fetch the data. Create new ULTs (helper xstream) to calculate checksum for data Compare calculated checksum with stored checksum. After every checksum is calculated, determine if need to sleep or yield . If checksums don't match confirm record is still there (not deleted by aggregation) then update record as corrupted After each object scanned yield to allow the server scheduler to reschedule the next appropriate I/O. Sleep or Yield \u00b6 Sleep for sufficient amount of time to ensure that scanning completes no sooner than configured interval (i.e. once a week or month). For example, if the interval is 1 week and there are 70 checksums that need to be calculated, then at a maximum 10 checksums are calculated a day, spaced roughly every 2.4 hours. If it doesn't need to sleep, then it will yield to allow the server scheduler to prioritize other jobs. Corrective Actions \u00b6 There are two main options for corrective actions when data corruption is discovered, in place data repair and SSD eviction. In Place Data Repair \u00b6 If enabled, when corruption is detected, the value identifier (dkey, akey, recx) will be placed in a queue. When there are available cycles, the value identifier will be used to request the data from a replica if exists and rewrite the data locally. This will continue until the SSD Eviction threshold is reached, in which case, the SSD is assumed to be bad enough that it isn't worth fixing locally and it will be requested to be evicted. SSD Eviction \u00b6 If enabled, when the SSD Eviction Threshold is reached the SSD will be evicted. Current eviction methods are pool and target based so there will need to be a mapping and mechanism in place to evict an SSD. When an SSD is evicted, the rebuild protocol will be invoked. Also, once the SSD Eviction Threshold is reached, the scanner should quit scanning anything on that SSD. Additional Checksum Properties > doc/user/container.md / doc/user/pool.md? \u00b6 These properties are provided when a container or pool is created, but should also be able to update them. When updated, they should be active right away. - Scanner Interval - Minimum number of days scanning will take. Could take longer, but if only a few records will pad so takes longer. (Pool property) - Disable scrubbing - at container level & pool level - Threshold for when to evict SSD (number of corruption events) - In Place Correction - If the number checksum errors is below the Eviction Threshold, DAOS will attempt to repair the corrupted data using replicas if they exist. Design Details & Implementation \u00b6 Pool ULT \u00b6 The code for the pool ULT is found in srv_pool_scrub.c . It can be a bit difficult to follow because there are several layers of callback functions due to the nature of how ULTs and the vos_iterator work, but the file is organized such that functions typically call the function above it (either directly or indirectly as a callback). For example (~> is an indirect call, -> is a direct call): ds_start_scrubbing_ult ~> scrubbing_ult -> scrub_pool ~> cont_iter_scrub_cb -> scrub_cont ~> obj_iter_scrub_cb ...

The vos update api already accepts a flag, so a CORRUPTED flag is added and handled during an update so that, if set, the bio address will be updated to be corrupted.

While each component in the system (network layer, storage devices) may offer protection against silent data corruption, DAOS provides end-to-end data integrity using checksums to better ensure that user data is not corrupted silently. For DAOS, end-to-end means that the client will calculate and verify checksums, providing protection for data through the entire I/O stack. During a write or update, the DAOS Client library (libdaos.so) calculates a checksum and appends it to the RPC message before transferred over the network. Depending on the configuration, the DAOS Server may or may not calculate checksums to verify the data on receipt. On a fetch, the DAOS Server will send a known good checksum with the requested data to the DAOS Client, which will calculate checksums on the data received and verify.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"overview/data_integrity/#requirements","text":"","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"overview/data_integrity/#key-requirements","text":"There are two key requirements that DAOS will support. 1.

Each target is thus effectively a single point of failure. DAOS achieves availability and durability of both data and metadata by providing redundancy across targets in different fault domains. DAOS internal pool and container metadata are replicated via a robust consensus algorithm. DAOS objects are then safely replicated or erasure-coded by transparently leveraging the DAOS distributed transaction mechanisms internally. The purpose of this section is to provide details on how DAOS achieves fault tolerance and guarantees object resilience. Hierarchical Fault Domains \u00b6 A fault domain is a set of servers sharing the same point of failure and which are thus likely to fail altogether. DAOS assumes that fault domains are hierarchical and do not overlap. The actual hierarchy and fault domain membership must be supplied by an external database used by DAOS to generate the pool map. Pool metadata are replicated on several nodes from different high-level fault domains for high availability, whereas object data is replicated or erasure-coded over a variable number of fault domains depending on the selected object class. Fault Detection \u00b6 DAOS servers are monitored within a DAOS system through a gossip-based protocol called SWIM that provides accurate, efficient, and scalable server fault detection. Storage attached to each DAOS target is monitored through periodic local health assessment. Whenever a local storage I/O error is returned to the DAOS server, an internal health check procedure will be called automatically. This procedure will make an overall health assessment by analyzing the IO error code and device SMART/Health data. If the result is negative, the target will be marked as faulty, and further I/Os to this target will be rejected and re-routed. Fault Isolation \u00b6 Once detected, the faulty target or servers (effectivelly a set of targets) must be excluded from the pool map. This process is triggered either manually by the administrator or automatically. Upon exclusion, the new version of the pool map is eagerly pushed to all storage targets. At this point, the pool enters a degraded mode that might require extra processing on access (e.g. reconstructing data out of erasure code). Consequently, DAOS client and storage nodes retry RPC indefinitely until they find an alternative replacement target from the new pool map. At this point, all outstanding communications with the evicted target are aborted, and no further messages should be sent to the target until it is explicitly reintegrated (possibly only after maintenance action). All storage targets are promptly notified of pool map changes by the pool service. This is not the case for client nodes, which are lazily informed of pool map invalidation each time they communicate with servers. To do so, clients pack in every RPC their current pool map version. Servers reply not only with the current pool map version. Consequently, when a DAOS client experiences RPC timeout, it regularly communicates with the other DAOS target to guarantee that its pool map is always current. Clients will then eventually be informed of the target exclusion and enter into degraded mode. This mechanism guarantees global node eviction and that all nodes eventually share the same view of target aliveness. Fault Recovery \u00b6 Upon exclusion from the pool map, each target starts the rebuild process automatically to restore data redundancy. First, each target creates a list of local objects impacted by the target exclusion. This is done by scanning a local object table maintained by the underlying storage layer. Then for each impacted object, the location of the new object shard is determined and redundancy of the object restored for the whole history (i.e., snapshots). Once all impacted objects have been rebuilt, the pool map is updated a second time to report the target as failed out. This marks the end of collective rebuild process and the exit from degraded mode for this particular fault. At this point, the pool has fully recovered from the fault and client nodes can now read from the rebuilt object shards. This rebuild process is executed online while applications continue accessing and updating objects.","title":"Fault Model"},{"location":"overview/fault/#fault-model","text":"DAOS relies on massively distributed single-ported storage.

At this point, all outstanding communications with the evicted target are aborted, and no further messages should be sent to the target until it is explicitly reintegrated (possibly only after maintenance action). All storage targets are promptly notified of pool map changes by the pool service. This is not the case for client nodes, which are lazily informed of pool map invalidation each time they communicate with servers. To do so, clients pack in every RPC their current pool map version. Servers reply not only with the current pool map version. Consequently, when a DAOS client experiences RPC timeout, it regularly communicates with the other DAOS target to guarantee that its pool map is always current. Clients will then eventually be informed of the target exclusion and enter into degraded mode. This mechanism guarantees global node eviction and that all nodes eventually share the same view of target aliveness.","title":"Fault Isolation"},{"location":"overview/fault/#fault-recovery","text":"Upon exclusion from the pool map, each target starts the rebuild process automatically to restore data redundancy. First, each target creates a list of local objects impacted by the target exclusion. This is done by scanning a local object table maintained by the underlying storage layer. Then for each impacted object, the location of the new object shard is determined and redundancy of the object restored for the whole history (i.e., snapshots). Once all impacted objects have been rebuilt, the pool map is updated a second time to report the target as failed out. This marks the end of collective rebuild process and the exit from degraded mode for this particular fault. At this point, the pool has fully recovered from the fault and client nodes can now read from the rebuilt object shards. This rebuild process is executed online while applications continue accessing and updating objects.","title":"Fault Recovery"},{"location":"overview/security/","text":"Security Model \u00b6 DAOS uses a flexible security model that separates authentication from authorization. It is designed to have a minimal impact on the I/O path. DAOS does not provide any transport security for the fabric network used for I/O transfers. When deploying DAOS, the administrator is responsible for secure configuration of their specific fabric network. For RDMA over Ethernet, enabling IPsec is recommended. See the RDMA protocol spec (RFC 5040) for more information. There are two areas where DAOS implements its own layer of security. At the user level, clients must be able to read and modify only pools and containers to which they have been granted access. At the system and administrative levels, only authorized components must be able to access the DAOS management network. Authentication \u00b6 There are different means of authentication, depending on whether the caller is accessing client resources or the DAOS management network. Client Library \u00b6 The client library libdaos is an untrusted component. The daos user-level command that uses the client library is also an untrusted component. A trusted process, the DAOS agent ( daos_agent ), runs on each client node and authenticates the user processes. The DAOS security model is designed to support different authentication methods for client processes. Currently, we support AUTH_SYS authentication only. DAOS Management Network \u00b6 Each trusted DAOS component ( daos_server , daos_agent , and the dmg administrative tool) is authenticated by means of a certificate generated for that component. These components identify one another over the DAOS management network via mutually-authenticated TLS. Authorization \u00b6 Client authorization for resources is controlled by the Access Control List (ACL) on the resource. Authorization on the management network is achieved by settings on the certificates that are generated while setting up the DAOS system. Component Certificates \u00b6 Access to DAOS management RPCs is controlled via the CommonName (CN) set in each management component certificate. A given management RPC may only be invoked by a component which connects with the correct certificate. Access Control Lists \u00b6 Client access to resources like pools and containers is controlled by DAOS Access Control Lists (ACLs). These ACLs are derived in part from NFSv4 ACLs, and adapted for the unique needs of a distributed system. The client may request read-only or read-write access to the resource. If the resource ACL doesn't grant them the requested access level, they won't be able to connect. While connected, their handle to that resource grants permissions for specific actions. The permissions of a handle last for the duration of its existence, similar to an open file descriptor in a POSIX system. A handle cannot currently be revoked. Access Control Entries \u00b6 In the input and output of DAOS tools, an Access Control Entry (ACE) is defined using a colon-separated string with the following format: TYPE:FLAGS:PRINCIPAL:PERMISSIONS The contents of all the fields are case-sensitive. Type \u00b6 The type of ACE entry (mandatory). Only one type of ACE is supported at this time. A (Allow): Allow access to the specified principal for the given permissions. Flags \u00b6 The (optional) flags provide additional information about how the ACE should be interpreted. G (Group): The principal should be interpreted as a group. Principal \u00b6 The principal (also called the identity) is specified in the name@domain format. The domain should be left off if the name is a UNIX user/group on the local domain. Currently, this is the only case supported by DAOS. There are three special principals, OWNER@ , GROUP@ , and EVERYONE@ , which align with User, Group, and Other from traditional POSIX permission bits. When providing them in the ACE string format, they must be spelled exactly as written here, in uppercase with no domain appended. The GROUP@ entry must also have the G (group) flag. Permissions \u00b6 The permissions in a resource's ACE permit a certain type of user access to the resource. The order of the permission \"bits\" (characters) within the PERMISSIONS field of the ACE is not significant. Permission Pool Meaning Container Meaning r (Read) Alias for 't' Read container data and attributes w (Write) Alias for 'c' + 'd' Write container data and attributes c (Create) Create containers N/A d (Delete) Delete any container Delete this container t (Get-Prop) Connect/query Get container properties T (Set-Prop) N/A Set/Change container properties a (Get-ACL) N/A Get container ACL A (Set-ACL) N/A Set/Change container ACL o (Set-Owner) N/A Set/Change container's owner user and group ACEs containing permissions not applicable to the given resource are considered invalid. To allow a user/group to connect to a resource, that principal's permissions must include at least some form of read access (for example, read or get-prop ). A user with write -only permissions will be rejected when requesting RW access to a resource. Denying Access \u00b6 Currently, only \"Allow\" Access Control Entries are supported. However, it is possible to deny access to a specific user by creating an Allow entry for them with no permissions. This is fundamentally different from removing a user's ACE, which allows other ACEs in the ACL to determine their access. It is not possible to deny access to a specific group in this way, due to the way group permissions are enforced . ACE Examples \u00b6 A::daos_user@:rw Allow the UNIX user named daos_user to have read-write access. A:G:project_users@:tc Allow anyone in the UNIX group project_users to access a pool's contents and create containers. A::OWNER@:rwdtTaAo Allow the UNIX user who owns the container to have full control. A:G:GROUP@:rwdtT Allow the UNIX group that owns the container to read and write data, delete the container, and manipulate container properties. A::EVERYONE@:r Allow any user not covered by other rules to have read-only access. A::daos_user@: Deny the UNIX user named daos_user any access to the resource. Enforcement \u00b6 Access Control Entries (ACEs) will be enforced in the following order: Owner-User Named users Owner-Group and named groups Everyone In general, enforcement will be based on the first match, ignoring lower-priority entries. If the user is the owner of the resource and there is an OWNER@ entry, they will receive the owner permissions only. They will not receive any of the permissions in the named user/group entries, even if they would match those other entries. If the user isn't the owner, or there is no OWNER@ entry, but there is an ACE for their user identity, they will receive the permissions for their user identity only. They will not receive the permissions for any of their groups, even if those group entries have broader permissions than the user entry does. The user is expected to match at most one user entry. If no matching user entry is found, but entries match one or more of the user's groups, enforcement will be based on the union of the permissions of all matching groups, including the owner-group GROUP@ . If no matching groups are found, the EVERYONE@ entry's permissions will be used, if it exists. By default, if a user matches no ACEs in the ACL list, access will be denied. ACL File \u00b6 Tools that accept an ACL file expect it to be a simple text file with one ACE on each line. A line may be marked as a comment by using a # as the first non-whitespace character on the line. For example: # ACL for my container # Owner can't touch data - just do admin-type things A::OWNER@:dtTaAo # My project's users can generate and access data A:G:my_great_project@:rw # Bob can use the data to generate a report A::bob@:r The permission bits and the ACEs themselves don't need to be in any specific order. However the order may be different when the resulting ACL is parsed and displayed by DAOS. Limitations \u00b6 The maximum size of the ACE list in a DAOS ACL internal data structure is 64KiB. To calculate the internal data size of an ACL, use the following formula for each ACE: The base size of an ACE is 256 Bytes. If the ACE principal is not one of the special principals: Add the length of the principal string + 1. If that value is not 64-Byte aligned, round up to the nearest 64-Byte boundary.","title":"Security Model"},{"location":"overview/security/#security-model","text":"DAOS uses a flexible security model that separates authentication from authorization.

A DAOS pool is a storage reservation distributed across a collection of targets . The actual space allocated to the pool on each target is called a pool shard . The total space allocated to a pool is decided at creation time. It can be expanded over time by resizing all the pool shards (within the limit of the storage capacity dedicated to each target), or by spanning more targets (adding more pool shards). A pool offers storage virtualization and is the unit of provisioning and isolation. DAOS pools cannot span across multiple systems. A pool can host multiple transactional object stores called DAOS containers . Each container is a private object address space, which can be modified transactionally and independently of the other containers stored in the same pool. A container is the unit of snapshot and data management. DAOS objects belonging to a container can be distributed across any target of the pool for both performance and resilience and can be accessed through different APIs to represent structured, semi-structured and unstructured data efficiently The table below shows the targeted level of scalability for each DAOS concept. DAOS Concept Scalability (Order of Magnitude) System 10 5 Servers (hundreds of thousands) and 10 2 Pools (hundreds) Server 10 1 Targets (tens) Pool 10 2 Containers (hundreds) Container 10 9 Objects (billions) DAOS Pool \u00b6 A pool is identified by a unique pool UUID and maintains target memberships in a persistent versioned list called the pool map . The membership is definitive and consistent, and membership changes are sequentially numbered. The pool map not only records the list of active targets, it also contains the storage topology in the form of a tree that is used to identify targets sharing common hardware components. For instance, the first level of the tree can represent targets sharing the same motherboard, and then the second level can represent all motherboards sharing the same rack and finally the third level can represent all racks in the same cage. This framework effectively represents hierarchical fault domains, which are then used to avoid placing redundant data on targets subject to correlated failures. At any point in time, new targets can be added to the pool map, and failed targets can be excluded. Moreover, the pool map is fully versioned, which effectively assigns a unique sequence to each modification of the map, particularly for failed node removal. A pool shard is a reservation of persistent memory optionally combined with a pre-allocated space on NVMe storage on a specific target. It has a fixed capacity and fails operations when full. Current space usage can be queried at any time and reports the total amount of bytes used by any data type stored in the pool shard. Upon target failure and exclusion from the pool map, data redundancy inside the pool is automatically restored online. This self-healing process is known as rebuild . Rebuild progress is recorded regularly in special logs in the pool stored in persistent memory to address cascading failures. When new targets are added, data is automatically migrated to the newly added targets to redistribute space usage equally among all the members. This process is known as space rebalancing and uses dedicated persistent logs as well to support interruption and restart. A pool is a set of targets spread across different storage nodes over which data and metadata are distributed to achieve horizontal scalability, and replicated or erasure-coded to ensure durability and availability. When creating a pool, a set of system properties must be defined to configure the different features supported by the pool. Also, users can define their attributes that will be stored persistently. A pool is only accessible to authenticated and authorized applications. Multiple security frameworks could be supported, from NFSv4 access control lists to third party-based authentication (such as Kerberos). Security is enforced when connecting to the pool. Upon successful connection to the pool, a connection context is returned to the application process. As detailed previously, a pool stores many different sorts of persistent metadata, such as the pool map, authentication and authorization information, user attributes, properties, and rebuild logs. Such metadata is critical and requires the highest level of resiliency. Therefore, the pool metadata is replicated on a few nodes from distinct high-level fault domains. For very large configurations with hundreds of thousands of storage nodes, only a very small fraction of those nodes (in the order of tens) run the pool metadata service . With a limited number of storage nodes, DAOS can afford to rely on a consensus algorithm to reach agreement, to guarantee consistency in the presence of faults, and to avoid the split-brain syndrome. To access a pool, a user process should connect to this pool and pass the security checks. Once granted, a pool connection can be shared (via local2global() and global2local() operations) with any or all of its peer application processes (similar to the openg() POSIX extension). This collective connect mechanism helps to avoid metadata request storm when a massively distributed job is run on the datacenter. A pool connection is revoked when the original process that issued the connection request disconnects from the pool. DAOS Container \u00b6 A container represents an object address space inside a pool and is identified by a container UUID . The diagram below represents how the user (I/O middleware, domain-specific data format, big data or AI framework, ...) could use the container concept to store related datasets. Like pools, containers can store user attributes. A set of properties must be passed at container creation time to configure different features like checksums. To access a container, an application must first connect to the pool and then open the container. If the application is authorized to access the container, a container handle is returned. This includes capabilities that authorize any process in the application to access the container and its contents. The opening process may share this handle with any or all of its peers. Their capabilities are revoked on container close. Objects in a container may have different schemas for data distribution and redundancy over targets. Dynamic or static striping, replication, or erasure code are some parameters required to define the object schema. The object class defines common schema attributes for a set of objects. Each object class is assigned a unique identifier and is associated with a given schema at the pool level. A new object class can be defined at any time with a configurable schema, which is then immutable after creation (or at least until all objects belonging to the class have been destroyed). For convenience, several object classes that are expected to be the most commonly used will be predefined by default when the pool is created, as shown in the table below. Sample of Pre-defined Object Classes Object Class (RW = read/write, RM = read-mostly Redundancy Layout (SC = stripe count, RC = replica count, PC = parity count, TGT = target Small size & RW Replication static SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 Small size & RM Erasure code static SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 Large size & RW Replication static SCxRC over max #targets) Large size & RM Erasure code static SCx(SC+PC) w/ max #TGT) Unknown size & RW Replication SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 initially and grows Unknown size & RM Erasure code SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 initially and grows As shown below, each object is identified in the container by a unique 128-bit object address . The high 32 bits of the object address is reserved for DAOS to encode internal metadata such as the object class. The remaining 96 bits are managed by the user and should be unique inside the container. Those bits can be used by upper layers of the stack to encode their metadata, as long as unicity is guaranteed. A per-container 64-bit scalable object ID allocator is provided in the DAOS API. The object ID to be stored by the application is the full 128-bit address, which is for single use only and can be associated with only a single object schema. DAOS Object ID Structure <---------------------------------- 128 bits ----------------------------------> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DAOS Internal Bits| Unique User Bits | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <---- 32 bits ----><------------------------- 96 bits -------------------------> A container is the basic unit of transaction and versioning. All object operations are implicitly tagged by the DAOS library with a timestamp called an epoch . The DAOS transaction API allows to combine multiple object updates into a single atomic transaction, with multi-version concurrency control based on epoch ordering. All the versioned updates may be periodically aggregated , to reclaim space utilized by overlapping writes and to reduce metadata complexity. A snapshot is a permanent reference that can be placed on a specific epoch to prevent aggregation. Container metadata (list of snapshots, container open handles, object class, user attributes, properties, and others) are stored in persistent memory and maintained by a dedicated container metadata service that either uses the same replicated engine as the parent metadata pool service, or has its own engine. This is configurable when creating a container. Like a pool, access to a container is controlled by the container handle. To acquire a valid handle, an application process must open the container and pass the security checks. This container handle may then be shared with other peer application processes via the container local2global() and global2local() operations. DAOS Object \u00b6 To avoid scaling problems and overhead common to a traditional storage system, DAOS objects are intentionally simple. No default object metadata beyond the type and schema is provided. This means that the system does not maintain time, size, owner, permissions or even track openers. To achieve high availability and horizontal scalability, many object schemas (replication/erasure code, static/dynamic striping, and others) are provided. The schema framework is flexible and easily expandable to allow for new custom schema types in the future. The layout is generated algorithmically on object open from the object identifier and the pool map. End-to-end integrity is assured by protecting object data with checksums during network transfer and storage. A DAOS object can be accessed through different APIs: Multi-level key-array API is the native object interface with locality feature. The key is split into a distribution (dkey) and an attribute (akey) key. Both the dkey and akey can be of variable length and type (a string, an integer or even a complex data structure). All entries under the same dkey are guaranteed to be collocated on the same target. The value associated with akey can be either a single variable-length value that cannot be partially overwritten, or an array of fixed-length values. Both the akeys and dkeys support enumeration. Key-value API provides a simple key and variable-length value interface. It supports the traditional put, get, remove and list operations. Array API implements a one-dimensional array of fixed-size elements addressed by a 64-bit offset. A DAOS array supports arbitrary extent read, write and punch operations.","title":"Storage Model"},{"location":"overview/storage/#storage-model","text":"","title":"Storage Model"},{"location":"overview/storage/#overview","text":"The figure below represents the fundamental abstractions of the DAOS storage model.

The diagram below represents how the user (I/O middleware, domain-specific data format, big data or AI framework, ...) could use the container concept to store related datasets. Like pools, containers can store user attributes. A set of properties must be passed at container creation time to configure different features like checksums. To access a container, an application must first connect to the pool and then open the container. If the application is authorized to access the container, a container handle is returned. This includes capabilities that authorize any process in the application to access the container and its contents. The opening process may share this handle with any or all of its peers. Their capabilities are revoked on container close. Objects in a container may have different schemas for data distribution and redundancy over targets. Dynamic or static striping, replication, or erasure code are some parameters required to define the object schema. The object class defines common schema attributes for a set of objects. Each object class is assigned a unique identifier and is associated with a given schema at the pool level. A new object class can be defined at any time with a configurable schema, which is then immutable after creation (or at least until all objects belonging to the class have been destroyed). For convenience, several object classes that are expected to be the most commonly used will be predefined by default when the pool is created, as shown in the table below. Sample of Pre-defined Object Classes Object Class (RW = read/write, RM = read-mostly Redundancy Layout (SC = stripe count, RC = replica count, PC = parity count, TGT = target Small size & RW Replication static SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 Small size & RM Erasure code static SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 Large size & RW Replication static SCxRC over max #targets) Large size & RM Erasure code static SCx(SC+PC) w/ max #TGT) Unknown size & RW Replication SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 initially and grows Unknown size & RM Erasure code SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 initially and grows As shown below, each object is identified in the container by a unique 128-bit object address . The high 32 bits of the object address is reserved for DAOS to encode internal metadata such as the object class. The remaining 96 bits are managed by the user and should be unique inside the container. Those bits can be used by upper layers of the stack to encode their metadata, as long as unicity is guaranteed. A per-container 64-bit scalable object ID allocator is provided in the DAOS API. The object ID to be stored by the application is the full 128-bit address, which is for single use only and can be associated with only a single object schema. DAOS Object ID Structure <---------------------------------- 128 bits ----------------------------------> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DAOS Internal Bits| Unique User Bits | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <---- 32 bits ----><------------------------- 96 bits -------------------------> A container is the basic unit of transaction and versioning. All object operations are implicitly tagged by the DAOS library with a timestamp called an epoch . The DAOS transaction API allows to combine multiple object updates into a single atomic transaction, with multi-version concurrency control based on epoch ordering. All the versioned updates may be periodically aggregated , to reclaim space utilized by overlapping writes and to reduce metadata complexity. A snapshot is a permanent reference that can be placed on a specific epoch to prevent aggregation. Container metadata (list of snapshots, container open handles, object class, user attributes, properties, and others) are stored in persistent memory and maintained by a dedicated container metadata service that either uses the same replicated engine as the parent metadata pool service, or has its own engine. This is configurable when creating a container. Like a pool, access to a container is controlled by the container handle. To acquire a valid handle, an application process must open the container and pass the security checks. This container handle may then be shared with other peer application processes via the container local2global() and global2local() operations.","title":"DAOS Container"},{"location":"overview/storage/#daos-object","text":"To avoid scaling problems and overhead common to a traditional storage system, DAOS objects are intentionally simple. No default object metadata beyond the type and schema is provided. This means that the system does not maintain time, size, owner, permissions or even track openers. To achieve high availability and horizontal scalability, many object schemas (replication/erasure code, static/dynamic striping, and others) are provided. The schema framework is flexible and easily expandable to allow for new custom schema types in the future. The layout is generated algorithmically on object open from the object identifier and the pool map. End-to-end integrity is assured by protecting object data with checksums during network transfer and storage. A DAOS object can be accessed through different APIs: Multi-level key-array API is the native object interface with locality feature. The key is split into a distribution (dkey) and an attribute (akey) key. Both the dkey and akey can be of variable length and type (a string, an integer or even a complex data structure). All entries under the same dkey are guaranteed to be collocated on the same target. The value associated with akey can be either a single variable-length value that cannot be partially overwritten, or an array of fixed-length values. Both the akeys and dkeys support enumeration. Key-value API provides a simple key and variable-length value interface. It supports the traditional put, get, remove and list operations. Array API implements a one-dimensional array of fixed-size elements addressed by a 64-bit offset. A DAOS array supports arbitrary extent read, write and punch operations.","title":"DAOS Object"},{"location":"overview/terminology/","text":"Terminology \u00b6 Acronym Expansion ABT Argobots ACL Access Control List ACE Access Control Entry ACID Atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability BIO Blob I/O CART Collective and RPC Transport CGO Go tools that enable creation of Go packages that call C code CN Compute Node COTS Commercial off-the-shelf CPU Central Processing Unit Daemon A process offering system-level resources.

Distributed consistency is provided via a lockless optimistic concurrency control mechanism based on multi-version timestamp ordering. DAOS transactions are serializable and can be used on an ad-hoc basis for parts of the datasets that need it. The DAOS versioning mechanism allows creating persistent container snapshots which provide point-in-time distributed consistent views of a container which can be used to build producer-consumer pipeline. Epoch and Timestamp Ordering \u00b6 Each DAOS I/O operation is tagged with a timestamp called epoch . An epoch is a 64-bit integer that integrates both logical and physical clocks (see HLC paper ). The DAOS API provides helper functions to convert an epoch to traditional POSIX time (i.e., struct timespec , see clock_gettime(3) ). Container Snapshot \u00b6 As shown in the figure below, the content of a container can be snapshot at any time. DAOS snapshots are very lightweight and are tagged with the epoch associated with the time when the snapshot was created. Once successfully created, a snapshot remains readable until it is explicitly destroyed. The content of a container can be rolled back to a particular snapshot. The container snapshot feature allows supporting native producer/consumer pipelines as represented in the diagram below. The producer will generate a snapshot once a consistent version of the dataset has been successfully written. The consumer applications may subscribe to container snapshot events, so that new updates can be processed as the producer commits them. The immutability of the snapshots guarantees that the consumer sees consistent data, even while the producer continues with new updates. Both the producer and consumer indeed operate on different versions of the container and do not need any serialization. Once the producer generates a new version of the dataset, the consumer may query the differences between the two snapshots and process only the incremental changes. Distributed Transactions \u00b6 Unlike POSIX, the DAOS API does not impose any worst-case concurrency control mechanism to address conflicting I/O operations. Instead, individual I/O operations are tagged with a different epoch and applied in epoch order, regardless of execution order. This baseline model delivers the maximum scalability and performance to data models and applications that do not generate conflicting I/O workload. Typical examples are collective MPI-IO operations, POSIX file read/write or HDF5 dataset read/write. For parts of the data model that require conflict serialization, DAOS provides distributed serializable transaction based on multi-version concurrency control.

This document contains the following sections: Storage Management and Workflow Integration Workflow Execution Bulk Synchronous Checkpoint Producer/Consumer Concurrent Producers Storage Node Failure and Resilvering Storage Management & Workflow Integration \u00b6 In this section, we consider two different cluster configurations: Cluster A: All or a majority of the compute nodes have local persistent memory. In other words, each compute node is also a storage node. Cluster B: Storage nodes are dedicated to storage and disseminated across the fabric. They are not used for computation and thus do not run any application code. At boot time, each storage node starts the DAOS server that instantiates service threads. In cluster A, the DAOS threads are bound to the noisy cores and interact with the FWK if mOS is used. In cluster B, the DAOS server can use all the cores of the storage node. The DAOS server then loads the storage management module. This module scans for local storage on the node and reports the result to a designated master DAOS server that aggregates information about the used and available storage across the cluster. The management module also retrieves the fault domain hierarchy (from a database or specific service) and integrates this with the storage information. The resource manager then uses the DAOS management API to query available storage and allocate a certain amount of storage (i.e. persistent memory) for a new workflow that is to be scheduled. In cluster A, this allocation request may list the compute nodes where the workflow is supposed to run, whereas in case B, it may ask for storage nearby some allocated compute nodes. Once successfully allocated, the master server will initialize a DAOS pool covering the allocated storage by formatting the VOS layout (i.e. fallocate(1) a PMEM file & create VOS super block) and starting the pool service which will initiate the Raft engine in charge of the pool membership and metadata. At this point, the DAOS pool is ready to be handed off to the actual workflow. When the workflow starts, one rank connects to the DAOS pool, then uses local2global() to generate a global connection handle and shares it with all the other application ranks that use global2local() to create a local connection handle. At that point, new containers can be created and existing ones opened collectively or individually by the application tasks. Workflow Execution \u00b6 We consider the workflow represented in the figure below. Each green box represents a different container. All containers are stored in the same DAOS pool represented by the gray box. The simulation reads data from the input container and writes raw timesteps to another container. It also regularly dumps checkpoints to a dedicated ckpt container. The down-sample job reads the raw timesteps and generates sampled timesteps to be analyzed by the post-process which stores analysis data into yet another container. Bulk Synchronous Checkpoint \u00b6 Defensive I/O is used to manage a large simulation run over a period of time larger than the platform's mean time between failure (MTBF). The simulation regularly dumps the current computation state to a dedicated container used to guarantee forward progress in the event of failures. This section elaborates on how checkponting could be implemented on top of the DAOS storage stack. We first consider the traditional approach relying on blocking barriers and then a more loosely coupled execution. Blocking Barrier When the simulation job starts, one task opens the checkpoint container and fetches the current global HCE. It thens obtains an epoch hold and shares the data (the container handle, the current LHE and global HCE) with peer tasks. Each task checks for the latest computation state saved to the checkpoint container by reading with an epoch equal to the global HCE and resumes computation from where it was last checkpointed. To checkpoint, each task executes a barrier to synchronize with the other tasks, writes its current computation state to the checkpoint container at epoch LHE, flushes all updates and finally executes another barrier. Once all tasks have completed the last barrier, one designated task (e.g. rank 0) commits the LHE which is then increased by one on successful commit. This process is repeated regularly until the simulation successfully completes. Non-blocking Barrier We now consider another approach to checkpointing where the execution is more loosely coupled. As in the previous case, one task is responsible for opening the checkpoint container, fetching the global HCE, obtaining an epoch hold and sharing the data with the other peer tasks. However, tasks can now checkpoint their computation state at their own pace without waiting for each other. After the computation of N timesteps, each task dumps its state to the checkpoint container at epoch LHE+1, flushes the changes and calls a non-blocking barrier (e.g. MPI_Ibarrier()) once done. Then after another N timesteps, the new checkpoint is written with epoch LHE+2 and so on. For each checkpoint, the epoch number is incremented. Moreover, each task regularly calls MPI_Test() to check for barrier completion which allows them to recycle the MPI_Request. Upon barrier completion, one designated task (typically rank 0) also commits the associated epoch number. All epochs are guaranteed to be committed in sequence and each committed epoch is a new consistent checkpoint to restart from. On failure, checkpointed states that have been written by individual tasks, but not committed, are automatically rolled back. Producer/Consumer \u00b6 In the previous figure , we have two examples of producer/consumer. The down-sample job consumes raw timesteps generated by the simulation job and produces sampled timesteps analyzed by the post-process job. The DAOS stack provides specific mechanims for producer/consumer workflow which even allows the consumer to dumps the result of its analysis into the same container as the producer. Private Container The down-sample job opens the sampled timesteps container, fetches the current global HCE, obtains an epoch hold and writes new sampled data to this container at epoch LHE. While this is occurring, the post process job opens the container storing analyzed data for write, checks for the latest analyzed timesteps and obtains an epoch hold on this container. It then opens the sampled timesteps container for read, and checks whether the next time-step to be consumed is ready. If not, it waits for a new global HCE to be committed (notified by asynchronous event completion on the event queue) and checks again. When the requested time-step is available, the down-sample job processes input data for this new time-step, dumps the results in its own container and updates the latest analyzed time-step in its metadata. It then commits updates to its output container and waits again for a new epoch to be committed and repeats the same process. Another approach is for the producer job to create explicit snapshots for epochs of interest and have the analysis job waiting and processing snapshots. This avoid processing every single committed epoch. Shared Container We now assume that the container storing the sampled timesteps and the one storing the analyzed data are a single container. In other words, the down-sample job consumes input data and writes output data to the same container. The down-sample job opens the shared container, obtains an hold and dumps new sampled timesteps to the container. As before, the post-process job also opens the container, fetches the latest analyzed timestep, but does not obtain an epoch hold until a new global HCE is ready. Once the post-process job is notified of a new global HCE, it can analyze the new sampled timesteps, obtain an hold and write its analyzed data to the same container. Once this is done, the post-process job flushes its updates, commits the held epoch and releases the held epoch. At that point, it can wait again for a new global HCE to be generated by the down-sample job. Concurrent Producers \u00b6 In the previous section, we consider a producer and a consumer job concurrently reading and writing into the same container, but in disjoint objects. We now consider a workflow composed of concurrent producer jobs modifying the same container in a conflicting and uncoordinated manner. This effectively means that the two producers can update the same key of the same KV object or document store or overlapping extents of the same byte array. This model requires the implementation of a concurrency-control mechanism (not part of DAOS) to coordinate conflicting accesses. This section presents an example of such a mechanism based on locking, but alternative approaches can also be considered. A workflow is composed of two applications using a distributed lock manager to serialize contended accesses to DAOS objects. Each application individually opens the same container and grabs an epoch hold whenever it wants to modify some objects in the container. Prior to modifying an object, an application should acquire a write lock on the object. This lock carries a lock value block (LVB) storing the last epoch number in which this object was last modified and committed. Once the lock is acquired, the writer must: read from an epoch equal to the greatest of the epoch specified in the LVB and the handle LRE. submit new writes with an epoch higher than the one in the LVB and the currently held epoch. After all the I/O operations have been completed, flushed, and committed by the application, the LVB is updated with the committed epoch in which the object was modified, and the lock can finally be released. Storage Node Failure and Resilvering \u00b6 In this section, we consider a workflow connected to a DAOS pool and one storage node that suddenly fails. Both DAOS clients and servers communicating with the failed server experience RPC timeouts and inform the RAS system. Failing RPCs are resent repeatedly until the RAS system or the pool metadata service itself decides to declare the storage node dead and evicts it from the pool map. The pool map update, along with the new version, is propagated to all the storage nodes that lazily (in RPC replies) inform clients that a new pool map version is available. Both clients and servers are thus eventually informed of the failure and enter into recovery mode. Server nodes will cooperate to restore redundancy on different servers for the impacted objects, whereas clients will enter in degraded mode and read from other replicas, or reconstruct data from erasure code. This rebuild process is executed online while the container is still being accessed and modified. Once redundancy has been restored for all objects, the poolmap is updated again to inform everyone that the system has recovered from the fault and the system can exit from degraded mode.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"overview/use_cases/#use-cases","text":"This section provides a non-exhaustive list of use cases presenting how the DAOS storage model and stack could be used on a real HPC cluster.

Both DAOS clients and servers communicating with the failed server experience RPC timeouts and inform the RAS system. Failing RPCs are resent repeatedly until the RAS system or the pool metadata service itself decides to declare the storage node dead and evicts it from the pool map. The pool map update, along with the new version, is propagated to all the storage nodes that lazily (in RPC replies) inform clients that a new pool map version is available. Both clients and servers are thus eventually informed of the failure and enter into recovery mode. Server nodes will cooperate to restore redundancy on different servers for the impacted objects, whereas clients will enter in degraded mode and read from other replicas, or reconstruct data from erasure code. This rebuild process is executed online while the container is still being accessed and modified. Once redundancy has been restored for all objects, the poolmap is updated again to inform everyone that the system has recovered from the fault and the system can exit from degraded mode.","title":"Storage Node Failure and Resilvering"},{"location":"release/releaseNote_v1_0/","text":"DAOS Version 1.0 Release Notes \u00b6 We are pleased to announce the release of DAOS version 1.0, a key DAOS milestone focused on a newly created high-performance object store that is ultimately shifting the HPC and big data paradigm. Recently awarded the top spot in the IO500 10-node Challenge , DAOS is fully optimized for Intel(R) architecture and non-volatile memory (NVM). This release is targeted towards benchmarking, partner integration, evaluation, and brings support for the following features: NVMe and Persistent Memory support Per-pool ACL Certificate Support Unified Namespace via dfuse MPI-IO ROMIO Driver HDF5 Support Basic POSIX I/O Support Replication and Self-Healing (Preview) This release is not yet intended for production use. DAOS is an open-source, software-defined storage (SDS) and storage-as-a-service (STaaS) platform. This technology was developed from the ground up for nextgen NVM technologies like Intel(R) 3D NAND Technology and Intel(R) Optane technology. DAOS operates end-to-end in user-space for ease of deployment and to maximize IOPS, bandwidth, and minimize latency. DAOS is a scale-out solution allowing small and medium deployments to grow as much as required (i.e., 100's of PB with millions of client nodes and thousands of storage servers) to serve the most demanding scientific, Big Data and AI workloads. The primary storage for the first US Exascale supercomputer (the Aurora system at Argonne National Laboratory - ANL) will be a 230PB DAOS tier composed to deliver an aggregated bandwidth of at least 25TB/s. Intel is collaborating closely with different partners to propose DAOS-based solutions for production deployments. DAOS is gaining traction among the enterprise and hyperscalers. Designed to address evolving storage needs, DAOS is a new storage platform for the convergence of traditional modeling and simulation, data science analytics, and artificial intelligence. Visit the DAOS github.io page for more information. All DAOS project source code is maintained in the https://github.com/daos-stack/daos repository. Please visit this link for more information on the licenses. Software Dependencies \u00b6 Reference the Software Installation section of the DAOS Administration Guide for more details. Distribution Packages \u00b6 DAOS RPMs are currently being developed for DAOS v1.0. Instructions for obtaining the RPMs will be provided in this document at a future date, and will be posted in the DAOS mailing list . Build Prerequisites \u00b6 To build DAOS and its dependencies, several software packages must be installed on the system. This includes scons, libuuid, cmocka, ipmctl, and several other packages usually available on all the Linux distributions. Moreover, a Go version of at least 1.10 is required. CentOS is currently the only supported Linux distribution. An exhaustive list of packages for each supported Linux distribution is maintained in the Docker files. Refer to the Software Installation section of the DAOS Administration Guide for more details. Hardware Support \u00b6 Processor Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires a 64-bit processor architecture and is primarily developed on Intel 64 architecture. The DAOS software and the libraries it depends on (e.g., ISA-L, SPDK, PMDK, and DPDK) can take advantage of Intel SSE and AVX extensions. Network Requirements \u00b6 The DAOS network layer relies on libfabrics and supports OFI providers for Ethernet/sockets, InfiniBand/verbs. An RDMA-capable fabric is preferred for better performance. DAOS can support multiple rails by binding different instances of the DAOS server to individual network cards. The DAOS control plane provides methods for administering and managing the DAOS servers using a secure socket layer interface. An additional out-of-band network connecting the nodes in the DAOS service cluster is required for DAOS administration. Management traffic between clients and servers use IP over Fabric. Storage Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires each storage node to have direct access to storage-class memory (SCM). While DAOS is primarily tested and tuned for Intel(R) Optane DC Persistent Memory, the DAOS software stack is built over the Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) and the DAX feature of the Linux operating systems as described in the SNIA NVM Programming Model . As a result, the open-source DAOS software stack should be able to run transparently over any storage-class memory supported by the PMDK. The storage node should be equipped with NVMe (non-volatile memory express) SSDs to provide capacity. HDDs, as well as SATA and SAS SSDs, are not supported by DAOS. Both NVMe 3D-NAND and Optane SSDs are supported. NVMe-oF devices should theoretically work with the user-space storage stack but have not been tested. A recommended ratio of 6% SCM to SSD capacity will guarantee that DAOS has enough space in SCM to store its internal metadata (e.g., pool metadata, SSD block allocation tracking). For testing purposes, SCM can be emulated with DRAM by mounting a tmpfs filesystem, and NVMe SSDs can be also emulated with DRAM or a loopback file. Any data written using a tmpfs will not be persistent across a reboot. DAOS Testing \u00b6 DAOS 1.0 validation efforts were focused on anticipated initial use cases including: system integration, application porting, benchmarking, initial evaluations, and the like. This release is not intended for large scale production use and testing to date has not focused on use cases or hardware typically found in HPC production environments. Testing has been completed in the following areas: Testing has been performed on Centos 7.7 and SLES 15 with Centos being used in the majority of the test cycles. Testing has been conducted using Intel Xeon processors, Intel 3D NAND and Optane based NVMe SSDs and Optane persistent memory modules although generally storage density was not tested at production levels. DAOS uses the libfabric network abstraction layer and testing has been performed on a number of network specific providers, including the IB verbs, OPA PSM2, socket and TCP providers. Network testing is on-going and none of the above providers should be considered fully tested at this time. All DAOS 1.0 supported functionality has been tested with an emphasis on use cases with positive outcomes error cases (e.g. DAOS server failure) have limited test cycles at this time. Maximum scale-out of DAOS servers during test runs was 128. Maximum scale-out of DAOS clients was 2048. Soak testing with an emphasis on I/O jobs in combination with basic administrative actions has been run and found to be error free for periods up to 48 hours. As with functional testing the focus has been on positive path testing with failure paths and fault injection coming in a future release. Version 1.0 major features \u00b6 NVMe and Persistent Memory Support \u00b6 DAOS supports two tiers of storage: Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVMe SSDs. Each DAOS server will be equipped with SCM (for byte-granular application data and metadata) along with NVMe SSDs (for DAOS application bulk data, ie >4KB). Similar to how PMDK is used to facilitate access to SCM, the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) is used to provide seamless and efficient access to NVMe SSDs. DAOS utilizes the significant performance increase of the SPDK user space NVMe driver over the standard NVMe kernel driver. As a part of the NVMe support, an extent-based block allocator was implemented and designed specifically for DAOS NVMe block device space management, including efficient management of smaller 4KB block allocations. A server module was also implemented for issuing I/O over NVMe SSDs. This involves internally managing a per-xstream DMA-safe buffer for SPDK DMA transfer over NVMe SSDs. The module also persistently tracks important server metadata. This per-server metadata includes the health state of each NVMe SSD, as well as the mapping between NVMe SSDs, DAOS server xstreams, DAOS pools, and allocated blocks IDs. Two other key components include faulty device detection and device health monitoring. DAOS handles storing NVMe SSD health data, including raw NVMe device health as well as I/O error and checksum errors counters. If and when an I/O error occurs, an event notification will be sent to the console to notify the administrator. Management utility commands are also available for administrators to query all NVMe device health stats to gauge the general health of the system. DAOS currently only supports manual faulty device events, with future work including auto-detection upon configurable faulty criteria. This would involve an administrator manually setting the device state of an NVMe SSD to FAULTY using the management utility, which will trigger the appropriate rebuild of data and exclusion of the faulty device from the system. Reintegration and hotplug of NVMe SSDs are not currently supported in DAOS 1.0 but will be a part of a future release. Per-Pool ACL \u00b6 Access to DAOS data is controlled through a simple identity based access control mechanism specified on a per pool basis. The access credentials for a DAOS client process are determined by the agent running on the compute node. This credential is validated against the Access Control List present on the DAOS server to determine the level of access granted to a specific user. The ACL mechanism support access permissions on an individual and group basis as well as a mechanism for supporting fall through users. As of DAOS 1.0, the set of permissions on a pool are very simple but will be extended when container-based ACLs are introduced in a future version. Certificate Support \u00b6 Securing the transport of data and authorizing actions by components make up the backbone of the security model used in the DAOS control plane. All control plane components communicate with each other using mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) backed by certificates signed by a per cluster certificate authority. In addition to securing, the communications between components, certificates are also used to authenticate the various components and ensure that requests only come from components who are authorized to perform those actions. Certificates are also used to secure the administrative interface to the cluster, ensuring only admins with the proper credentials can perform administrative actions. Unified Namespace (UNS) in DAOS via dfuse \u00b6 Unified NameSpace (UNS) is the ability to create relationships linking paths in the namespace tree to other DAOS containers, allowing greater flexibility of use and new workflows. UNS entry points can be created that behave in a similar way to hard links or submounts, where an attempt to traverse the entry point via dfuse or DAOS aware tools will automatically and seamlessly follow the link to the specified container. UNS entry points are created by providing a path to the DAOS container create command, and can exist either within existing containers or at locations within the regular POSIX filesystem. MPI-IO ROMIO Driver \u00b6 The MPI standard includes specification for a low level IO interface for parallel access to files. The MPI-IO standard loosens some of the POSIX semantics that are not required for many applications and defines routines and methods for parallel access to files from processes in an MPI communicator. Several existing applications and other high level middleware IO libraries use the MPI-IO standard as a backend for data access. ROMIO is the de-facto MPI-IO implementation that is released with the MPICH library and is used by most MPI implementations to support the MPI-IO standard. ROMIO exposes an ADIO module interface for different backends. A DAOS backend was implemented as an alternative to the POSIX backend for direct user-space access to the DAOS storage stack through the MPI-IO interface. The DAOS ROMIO driver is distributed with the MPICH ROMIO source code. HDF5 Support \u00b6 HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data. This DAOS release supports the HDF5 format, API, and tools through the HDF5 (sec2) POSIX backend or the HDF5 MPI-IO backend. HDF5 also provides a new DAOS VOL for mapping the HDF5 data model and API directly over the DAOS data model, bypassing the byte array serialization required over the POSIX and MPI-IO backends. The HDF5 DAOS VOL is not fully supported in this DAOS release and should be used as a prototype for basic testing of this new HDF5 feature. Basic POSIX I/O Support \u00b6 POSIX IO is the main building block for all applications and IO libraries. The DAOS library provides POSIX support through the DFS (DAOS File System) library. The DFS API provides an encapsulated namespace with a POSIX like API directly on top of the DAOS API. Applications can link directly to the DFS library and use the DFS API for direct user-space access to the DAOS stack through the DFS API. A FUSE plugin over the DFS library (dfuse) is also provided to support direct access to POSIX calls through FUSE over the DAOS stack. The primary support provided in this release provides loose POSIX consistency in terms of metadata and assumes applications generate conflict-free operations, otherwise, the behavior is undefined. FUSE adds stricter consistency on top of the DFS layer, but that consistency is limited to a node local instance of the dfuse mount. Replication and self-healing (preview) \u00b6 In DAOS, if the data is replicated with multiple copies on different targets, once one of the targets fail, the data on it will be rebuilt on the other targets. This reduces the data redundancy that would be impacted by the target failure. Self-healing in DAOS 1.0 is a preview feature, and it will not be enabled automatically when targets are failed; instead it can only be enabled manually by the dmg exclude command. In future versions, DAOS will support erasure coding to protect the data. At that time, the rebuild process will be updated accordingly. Document updates \u00b6 All documents supporting the https://daos-stack.github.io/ site have been refreshed and re-organized for this release. Design documents in the DAOS Source repository have also been refreshed for this release. Known Issues \u00b6 The dmg storage scan may report incorrect NUMA socket ID \u00b6 The ndctl package maintainers have confirmed that this is a kernel regression that has been resolved in CentOS 8. Some DAOS nodes may not report the correct NUMA socket ID when running a \"dmg storage scan.\" This appears to be a regression in the CentOS7.7 kernel rather than an ndctl issue. This is due to different versions of ndctl provisioning different JSON namespace details (storage scan command reads the \"numa_node\" field). PSM over OPA is not fully functional \u00b6 If you must evaluate DAOS on an OPA fabric, we recommend using IP over fabric/sockets for evaluation. For benchmarking, PSM2 over OPA offers a better picture of DAOS performance, but the PSM2 provider is not fully functional. For a discussion of issues and options, contact us via the mailing list . Replication and Self-healing \u00b6 While replication and self-healing features have been fully implemented, those features haven't been thoroughly tested in 1.0. As a result, they are supported as preview features and will be fully supported in the next release. The storage node fault detection has thus been disabled by default and failed storage nodes have to be excluded manually to trigger automatic repair. Please refer to the [Pool Modifications] (https://daos-stack.github.io/admin/pool_operations/#pool-modifications) section of the administration guide for more information. Limited bandwidth to SCM with some update/write operations \u00b6 With a configuration of only Intel(R) Optane Pmem for storage in a DAOS pool (no SSDs), a known limitation currently exists on the write/update performance with bulk transfers to the SCM with all network providers which limits the BW per storage server. Aggregation Issue \u00b6 The aggregation service is only activated after the system has idled for more than 5 seconds, so the aggregation is always suspended if there are sustained I/O requests from application. As a result, storage node will run out of SCM space even there is plenty of free space in SSD. Fixed Issues Details \u00b6 First release, this section will be updated in subsequent releases Change Log \u00b6 No changes for this first release.","title":"DAOS Version 1.0 Release Notes"},{"location":"release/releaseNote_v1_0/#daos-version-10-release-notes","text":"We are pleased to announce the release of DAOS version 1.0, a key DAOS milestone focused on a newly created high-performance object store that is ultimately shifting the HPC and big data paradigm.

This release is targeted towards benchmarking, partner integration, evaluation, and brings support for the following new features: Per-container ACL Improved Control Plane End-to-end Data Integrity Replication and Self Healing Offline Reintegration HDF5 DAOS VOL Connector POSIX I/O improvements POSIX Data Mover Apache Spark support Erasure Code (Preview) Visit the online documentation for more information. All DAOS project source code is maintained in the https://github.com/daos-stack/daos repository. Please visit this link for more information on the licenses. Software Installation \u00b6 Reference the Software Installation section of the DAOS Administration Guide for more details. Hardware Support \u00b6 Processor Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires a 64-bit processor architecture and is primarily developed on Intel 64 architecture. The DAOS software and the libraries it depends on (e.g., ISA-L, SPDK, PMDK, and DPDK) can take advantage of Intel SSE and AVX extensions. Network Requirements \u00b6 The DAOS network layer relies on libfabrics and supports OFI providers for Ethernet/sockets, InfiniBand/verbs. An RDMA-capable fabric is preferred for better performance. DAOS can support multiple rails by binding different instances of the DAOS server to individual network cards. The DAOS control plane provides methods for administering and managing the DAOS servers using a secure socket layer interface. An additional out-of-band network connecting the nodes in the DAOS service cluster is required for DAOS administration. Management traffic between clients and servers use IP over Fabric. Storage Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires each storage node to have direct access to storage-class memory (SCM). While DAOS is primarily tested and tuned for Intel(R) Optane PMEM, the DAOS software stack is built over the Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) and the DAX feature of the Linux operating systems as described in the SNIA NVM Programming Model . As a result, the open-source DAOS software stack should be able to run transparently over any storage-class memory supported by the PMDK. The storage node should be equipped with NVMe (non-volatile memory express) SSDs to provide capacity. HDDs, as well as SATA and SAS SSDs, are not supported by DAOS. Both NVMe 3D-NAND and Optane SSDs are supported. NVMe-oF devices should theoretically work with the user-space storage stack but have not been tested. A ratio of 6% SCM to SSD capacity is recommended to reserve enough space in SCM to store internal metadata (e.g., pool metadata, SSD block allocation tracking). For testing purposes, SCM can be emulated with DRAM by mounting a tmpfs filesystem, and NVMe SSDs can be also emulated with DRAM or a loopback file. Any data written using a tmpfs will not be persistent across a reboot. DAOS Testing \u00b6 DAOS 1.2 validation efforts were focused on anticipated initial use cases. Testing has been completed in the following areas: Testing has been performed on CentOS 7.9, OpenSuse 15.2, with CentOS being used in the majority of the test cycles. Smaller scale testing has been done on OpenSuse 15.2, and no testing performed on Ubuntu and MOFED 5.1x Testing has been conducted using Intel Xeon processors, Intel 3D NAND and Optane based NVMe SSDs and Optane persistent memory modules although generally storage density was not tested at production levels. DAOS uses the libfabric network abstraction layer and testing has been performed on a number of network specific providers, including the IB verbs, socket and TCP providers. Network testing is on-going and none of the above providers should be considered fully tested at this time. All DAOS 1.2 supported functionality has been tested with an emphasis on use cases with positive outcomes error cases (e.g., DAOS server failure) have limited test cycles at this time. Maximum scale-out of DAOS servers during test runs was 128. The number of client processes was scaled up to 512. Soak testing with an emphasis on I/O jobs in combination with basic administrative actions has been run and found to be error free for periods up to 48 hours. As with functional testing the focus has been on positive path testing with failure paths and fault injection coming in a future release. Version 1.2 major features \u00b6 End-to-end Data Integrity \u00b6 For DAOS, end-to-end means that the client will calculate and verify checksums, providing protection for data through the entire I/O stack. During a write or update, the DAOS Client library (libdaos.so) calculates a checksum and appends it to the RPC message before transferred over the network. Depending on the configuration, the DAOS Server may or may not calculate checksums to verify the data on receipt. On a fetch, the DAOS Server will send a known good checksum with the requested data to the DAOS Client, which will calculate checksums on the data received and verify. More information Per-container ACL \u00b6 Client user and group access for containers is controlled by Access Control Lists (ACLs). Access-controlled container accesses include: Opening the container for access. Reading and writing data in the container. Reading and writing objects. Getting, setting, and listing user attributes. Getting, setting, and listing snapshots. Deleting the container (if the pool does not grant the user permission). Getting and setting container properties. Getting and modifying the container ACL. Modifying the container's owner. This is reflected in the set of supported container permissions . More information External Device States (via dmg) \u00b6 The device states that are returned from a device query by the administrator are dependent on both the persistently stored device state in SMD, and the in-memory BIO device list. NORMAL: A fully functional device in use by DAOS (or in setup). EVICTED: A device has been manually evicted and is no longer in use by DAOS. UNPLUGGED: A device previously used by DAOS is unplugged. NEW: A new device is available for use by DAOS. More information User Interface Improvement \u00b6 The DAOS dmg management utility can be used to query NVMe SSD health data, as well as provide useful commands for NVMe SSD eviction, hot plug, and device identification. NVMe hot plug and reintegration will not be fully supported until DAOS 2.2 release. Manually evict and NVMe SSD Replace an evicted SSD with a new NVMe SSD Reuse a faulty NVMe SSD (w/o reintegration) Locate a healthy NVMe SSD (for VMD-enabled devices only) Locate an evicted NVMe SSD (for VMD-enabled devices only) More information Replication and Self Healing \u00b6 In DAOS, if the data is replicated with multiple copies on different storage nodes, once one of the node fail, the data on it will be rebuilt on the other targets. This reduces the data redundancy that would be impacted by the target failure. More information Offline Reintegration \u00b6 In DAOS, the excluded targets can be reintegrated back into the pool by dmg pool command, though the pool should not be connected (no I/O) during reintegration, otherwise application failure or even data corruption might be observed, which will be fixed in the later version. The status of the reintegration can also be checked through dmg pool query, similar as rebuild. During reintegration, all old data on the reintegrated target will be erased. Once the target is reintegrated, it operates the same as normal active targets. More information HDF5 DAOS VOL Connector \u00b6 The HDF5 Library is one of the major I/O libraries and binary file formats that is used among the HPC community. The HDF5 library has recently been enhanced to enable non-POSIX storage paradigms, such as object stores, enabling non-native file formats. A new architectural layer called the HDF5 Virtual Object Layer (VOL) was added to the library to redirect data from an HDF5 application to other types of storage using HDF5 VOL connectors. More information: https://github.com/HDFGroup/vol-daos https://github.com/HDFGroup/vol-daos/blob/master/docs/users_guide.pdf POSIX Data Mover \u00b6 The Dataset Mover is a collection of multiple tools that allow users to copy and serialize data across DAOS and POSIX file systems. There is support for data movement across POSIX, DAOS, and HDF5 containers. There is also support for serializing a DAOS container to an HDF5 file and deserializing back to DAOS. More information Apache Spark \u00b6 Support for Spark and Hadoop is available in this release. More information Erasure Code (Preview) \u00b6 This release implements Reed Solomon based EC for data protection of DAOS, it supports EC data recovery for storage target failure, and data migration while extending the storage pool. Main features of DAOS EC include: Reed-Solomon based EC support for I/O. DAOS has two value types: array value for large streaming I/O; single value for Key-value store. DAOS EC supports both array value and single value. An array value always has fixed stripe size and cell size, whereas a single value has dynamic stripe size to provide storage efficiency of application data with arbitrary size. This feature also provides a set of predefined EC object classes as its user interface. The user can choose the appropriate object class for their data based on their requirements and restrictions. For example, capacity and bandwidth overhead, fault tolerance level, etc. Versioned data aggregation for EC protected object. The data model of DAOS is multi-versioned: a write operation is non-destructive, and it is stored as a new version if a write overlaps with old data. The DAOS EC aggregation service can merge versioned data protected by EC, re-encode aggregated data, and reclaim space by removing old data versions. Data recovery for EC protected object. DAOS server failure may result in loss of access to part of the EC protected data. If number of failures is equal or less than the EC redundancy factor, DAOS client can retrieve a quorum of surviving cells and reconstruct the inaccessible data for application that is trying to read, whereas DAOS server can reconstruct lost data in the background and recover data redundancy to the original level. Document updates \u00b6 All documents supporting the https://daos-stack.github.io/ site have been refreshed for this release. Design documents in the DAOS Source repository have also been refreshed for this release. Known Issues \u00b6 PMEM Registration Failures with Verbs on Recent Kernels ( DAOS-6768 ) \u00b6 Memory registration failures when Leap15 + verbs;rxm + pmem combination is used without NVMe SSD configured in the pool. crt_bulk_create() fails with verbs level fi_mr_regv() failing with -95 error: Operation Not supported. If PMEM backed memory is replaced by tmpfs, then bulk creation succeeds. If FI_VERBS_USE_ODP is set, pmem-backed memory registration succeeds, however the ior test slows by 90%. This only appears to happen on Leap15.2 and not centos 7.9. This will be fixed in a future kernel update. daos_engine crashes when querying 200 pools ( DAOS-6505 ) \u00b6 This will be fixed in a future release. Soak: ior -a MPIIO reports DER_INVAL with oclass RP_2GX ( DAOS-6308 ) \u00b6 If failures reduce the number of available targets below the number required for an object, writes will not be possible until the system is repaired via reintegration, and data will be vulnerable to additional failures until that reintegration is complete. This will be fixed in a future release. Add support for co-located (targets) shards in placement ( DAOS-5499 ) \u00b6 If you have a widely striped object (or even just a \"normal object\" but a very small cluster) one or more failures might mean that your objects require more targets to place than are available on the system. This will be fixed in a future release. fio/libaio not working over dfuse with direct_io ( DAOS-5299 ) \u00b6 Trying to run fio over dfuse results in EINVAL errors in normal usage. When fio is using libaio as a backend, libaio is calling io_setup() which works, however, io_submit() is failing with EINVAL. Currently there is a bug where dfuse doesn't set the O_DIRECT flag. As a workaround, adding a --disable-directio flag to dfuse and setting this for the fio test. This will be fixed in a future kernel update. The dmg storage scan may report incorrect NUMA socket ID \u00b6 The ndctl package maintainers have confirmed that this is a kernel regression that has been resolved in CentOS 8. Some DAOS nodes may not report the correct NUMA socket ID when running a \"dmg storage scan.\" This appears to be a regression in the CentOS7.7 kernel rather than an ndctl issue. This is due to different versions of ndctl provisioning different JSON namespace details (storage scan command reads the \"numa_node\" field). The regression also affects the operation of the \"dmg config generate\" command which isn't able to detect correct NUMA affinity for the PMem namespaces required for the config. The regression has been fixed in the CentOS7.9 kernel. A fix for this is not planned. PSM over OPA is not fully functional \u00b6 If you must evaluate DAOS on an OPA fabric, we recommend using IP over fabric/sockets for evaluation. For benchmarking, PSM2 over OPA offers a better picture of DAOS performance, but the PSM2 provider is not fully functional. For a discussion of issues and options, contact us via the mailing list . Limited bandwidth to SCM with some update/write operations \u00b6 With a configuration of only Intel(R) Optane Pmem for storage in a DAOS pool (no SSDs), a known limitation currently exists on the write/update performance with bulk transfers to the SCM with all network providers which limits the BW per storage server.","title":"Release Notes v1.2"},{"location":"release/release_notes_v1_2/#daos-version-12-release-notes","text":"We are pleased to announce the release of DAOS version 1.2, advancing on a newly created high-performance object store that is ultimately shifting the HPC and big data paradigm.

Then subsequent invocations of the daos tools need to reference the path to the POSIX file or directory. $ daos cont create --pool=a171434a-05a5-4671-8fe2-615aa0d05094 \\ --path=/tmp/mycontainer --type=POSIX --oclass=large \\ --chunk_size=4K Successfully created container 419b7562-5bb8-453f-bd52-917c8f5d80d1 type POSIX $ daos container query --path=/tmp/mycontainer Pool UUID: a171434a-05a5-4671-8fe2-615aa0d05094 Container UUID: 419b7562-5bb8-453f-bd52-917c8f5d80d1 Number of snapshots: 0 Latest Persistent Snapshot: 0 DAOS Unified Namespace Attributes on path /tmp/mycontainer: Container Type: POSIX Object Class: large Chunk Size: 4096 Container Properties \u00b6 At creation time, a list of container properties can be specified: Container Property Description DAOS_PROP_CO_LABEL A string that a user can associate with a container. e.g., \"Cat Pics\" or \"ResNet-50 training data\" DAOS_PROP_CO_LAYOUT_TYPE The container type (POSIX, HDF5, ...) DAOS_PROP_CO_LAYOUT_VER A version of the layout that can be used by I/O middleware and application to handle interoperability. DAOS_PROP_CO_REDUN_FAC The redundancy factor that drives the minimal data protection required for objects stored in the container. e.g., RF1 means no data protection, RF3 only allows 3-way replication or erasure code N+2. DAOS_PROP_CO_REDUN_LVL The fault domain level that should be used to place data redundancy information (e.g., storage nodes, racks...). This information will be eventually consumed to determine object placement. While those properties are currently stored persistently with container metadata, many of them are still under development. The ability to modify some of these properties on an existing container will also be provided in a future release. Data Integrity \u00b6 DAOS allows to detect and fix (when data protection is enabled) silent data corruptions. This is done by calculating checksums for both data and metadata in the DAOS library on the client side and storing those checksums persistently in SCM. The checksums will then be validated on access and on update/write as well on the server side if server verify option is enabled. Corrupted data will never be returned to the application. When a corruption is detected, DAOS will try to read from a different replica, if any. If the original data cannot be recovered, then an error will be reported to the application. To enable and configure checksums, the following container properties are used during container create. DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM : Type of checksum algorithm to use. Supported values are DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_OFF, // default DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_CRC16, DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_CRC32, DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_CRC64, DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_SHA1, DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_SHA256, DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_SHA512, DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_ADLER32 DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_CHUNK_SIZE : defines the chunk size used for creating checksums of array types. (default is 32K). DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_SERVER_VERIFY : Because of the probable decrease to IOPS, in most cases, it is not desired to verify checksums on an object update on the server side. It is sufficient for the client to verify on a fetch because any data corruption, whether on the object update, storage, or fetch, will be caught. However, there is an advantage to knowing if corruption happens on an update. The update would fail right away, indicating to the client to retry the RPC or report an error to upper levels. Note Note that currently, once a container is created, its checksum configuration cannot be changed. Inline Deduplication (Preview) \u00b6 Data deduplication (dedup) is a process that allows to eliminate duplicated data copies in order to decrease capacity requirements. DAOS has some initial support of inline dedup. When dedup is enabled, each DAOS server maintains a per-pool table indexing extents by their hash (i.e. checksum). Any new I/Os bigger than the deduplication threshold will thus be looked up in this table to find out whether an existing extent with the same signature has already been stored. If an extent is found, then two options are provided: Transferring the data from the client to the server and doing a memory compare (i.e. memcmp) of the two extents to verify that they are indeed identical. Trusting the hash function and skipping the data transfer. To minimize issue with hash collision, a cryptographic hash function (i.e. SHA256) is used in this case. The benefit of this approarch is that the data to be written does not need to be transferred to the server. Data processing is thus greatly accelerated. The inline dedup feature can be enabled on a per-container basis. To enable and configure dedup, the following container properties are used: DAOS_PROP_CO_DEDUP : Type of dedup mechanism to use. Supported values are DAOS_PROP_CO_DEDUP_OFF, // default DAOS_PROP_CO_DEDUP_MEMCMP, // memory compare DAOS_PROP_CO_CSUM_HASH // hash-based using SHA256 DAOS_PROP_CO_DEDUP_THRESHOLD : defines the minimal I/O size to consider the I/O for dedup (default is 4K). Warning Dedup is a feature preview in 1.2 (i.e. master) and has some known limitations. Aggregation of deduplicated extents isn't supported and the checksum tree isn't persistent yet. This means that aggregation is disabled for a container with dedplication enabled and duplicated extents won't be matched after a server restart. NVMe isn't supported for dedup enabled container, so please make sure not using dedup on the pool with NVMe enabled. Compression & Encryption \u00b6 The DAOS_PROP_CO_COMPRESS and DAOS_PROP_CO_ENCRYPT properties are reserved for configuring respectively online compression and encryption. These features are currently not on the roadmap. Snapshot & Rollback \u00b6 Similar to container create/destroy, a container can be snapshotted through the DAOS API by calling daos_cont_create_snap(). Additional functions are provided to destroy and list container snapshots. The API also provides the ability to subscribe to container snapshot events and to rollback the content of a container to a previous snapshot, but those operations are not yet fully implemented. This section will be updated once support for container snapshot is supported by the daos tool. The DAOS_PROP_CO_SNAPSHOT_MAX property is used to limit the maximum number of snapshots to retain. When a new snapshot is taken, and the threshold is reached, the oldest snapshot will be automatically deleted. Rolling back the content of a container to a snapshot is planned for future DAOS versions. User Attributes \u00b6 Similar to POSIX extended attributes, users can attach some metadata to each container through the daos_cont_{list/get/set}_attr() API. Access Control Lists \u00b6 Client user and group access for containers is controlled by Access Control Lists (ACLs) . Access-controlled container accesses include: Opening the container for access. Reading and writing data in the container. Reading and writing objects. Getting, setting, and listing user attributes. Getting, setting, and listing snapshots. Deleting the container (if the pool does not grant the user permission). Getting and setting container properties. Getting and modifying the container ACL. Modifying the container's owner. This is reflected in the set of supported container permissions . Pool vs. Container Permissions \u00b6 In general, pool permissions are separate from container permissions, and access to one does not guarantee access to the other. However, a user must have permission to connect to a container's pool before they can access the container in any way, regardless of their permissions on that container. Once the user has connected to a pool, container access decisions are based on the individual container ACL. A user need not have read/write access to a pool in order to open a container with read/write access, for example. There is one situation in which the pool can grant a container-level permission: Container deletion. If a user has Delete permission on a pool, this grants them the ability to delete any container in the pool, regardless of their permissions on that container. If the user does not have Delete permission on the pool, they will only be able to delete containers for which they have been explicitly granted Delete permission in the container's ACL. Creating Containers with Custom ACL \u00b6 To create a container with a custom ACL: $ daos cont create --pool=<UUID> --acl-file=<path> The ACL file format is detailed in the ACL section . Displaying a Container's ACL \u00b6 To view a container's ACL: $ daos cont get-acl --pool=<UUID> --cont=<UUID> The output is in the same string format used in the ACL file during creation, with one ACE per line. Modifying a Container's ACL \u00b6 For all of these commands using an ACL file, the ACL file must be in the format noted above for container creation. Overwriting the ACL \u00b6 To replace a container's ACL with a new ACL: $ daos cont overwrite-acl --pool=<UUID> --cont=<UUID> \\ --acl-file=<path> Adding and Updating ACEs \u00b6 To add or update multiple entries in an existing container ACL: $ daos cont update-acl --pool=<UUID> --cont=<UUID> \\ --acl-file=<path> To add or update a single entry in an existing container ACL: $ daos cont update-acl --pool=<UUID> --cont=<UUID> --entry <ACE> If there is no existing entry for the principal in the ACL, the new entry is added to the ACL. If there is already an entry for the principal, that entry is replaced with the new one. Removing an ACE \u00b6 To delete an entry for a given principal in an existing container ACL: $ daos cont delete-acl --pool=<UUID> --cont=<UUID> \\ --principal=<principal> The principal corresponds to the principal portion of an ACE that was set during container creation or a previous container ACL operation. For the delete operation, the principal argument must be formatted as follows: Named user: u:username@ Named group: g:groupname@ Special principals: OWNER@ GROUP@ EVERYONE@ The entry for that principal will be completely removed. This does not always mean that the principal will have no access. Rather, their access to the container will be decided based on the remaining ACL rules. Ownership \u00b6 The ownership of the container corresponds to the special principals OWNER@ and GROUP@ in the ACL. These values are a part of the container properties. They may be set on container creation and changed later. Privileges \u00b6 The owner-user ( OWNER@ ) has implicit privileges on their container. The owner-user can always open the container, and has set-ACL (A) and get-ACL (a) permissions. These permissions are included alongside any permissions that the user was explicitly granted by entries in the ACL. Because the owner's special permissions are implicit, they apply to access control decisions even if they do not appear in the OWNER@ entry, and even if the OWNER@ entry is deleted. The owner-group ( GROUP@ ) has no special permissions outside what they are granted by the ACL. Creating Containers with Specific Ownership \u00b6 The default owner user and group are the effective user and group of the user creating the container. However, a specific user and/or group may be specified at container creation time. $ daos cont create --pool=<UUID> --user=<owner-user> \\ --group=<owner-group> The user and group names are case sensitive and must be formatted as DAOS ACL user/group principals . Changing Ownership \u00b6 To change the owner user: $ daos cont set-owner --pool=<UUID> --cont=<UUID> \\ --user=<owner-user> To change the owner group: $ daos cont set-owner --pool=<UUID> --cont=<UUID> \\ --group=<owner-group> The user and group names are case sensitive and must be formatted as DAOS ACL user/group principals .","title":"Container Management"},{"location":"user/container/#container-management","text":"DAOS containers are the unit of data management for users.","title":"Container Management"},{"location":"user/container/#container-creationdestroy","text":"Containers can be created and destroyed through the daos_cont_create/destroy() functions exported by the DAOS API.

Examples are available under src/tests . DAOS API Reference \u00b6 libdaos is written in C and uses Doxygen comments that are added to C header files. The Doxygen documentation is available here . Python Bindings \u00b6 A python module called PyDAOS provides the DAOS API to python users. pydaos \u00b6 pydaos provides a native DAOS python interface exported by a C module. It integrates the DAOS key-value store API with python dictionaries. Only strings are supported for both the key and value for now. Key-value pairs can be inserted/looked up one at a time (see put/get) or in bulk (see bput/bget) taking a python dict as an input. The bulk operations are issued in parallel (up to 16 operations in flight) to maximize the operation rate. Key-value pairs are deleted via the put/bput operations by setting the value to either None or the empty string. Once deleted, the key won't be reported during iteration. It also supports the del operation via 'del dkv.key'. The DAOS KV objects behave like a python dictionary and supports: 'dkv[key]' which invokes 'dkv.get(key)' 'dkv[key] = val' which invokes 'dkv.put(key, val)' 'for key in dkv:' allows to walk through the key space via the support of python iterators 'if key is in dkv:' allows to test whether a give key is present in the DAOS KV store. 'len(dkv)' returns the number of key-value pairs. 'bool(dkv)' reports 'False' if there is no key-value pairs in the DAOS KV and 'True' otherwise. Python iterators are supported, which means that \"for key in kvobj:\" will allow you to walk through the key space. For each method, a PyDError exception is raised with a proper DAOS error code (in string format) if the operation cannot be completed. Both python 2.7 and 3.x are supported. pydaos.raw \u00b6 The pydaos.raw submodule provides access to DAOS API functionality via Ctypes and was developed with an emphasis on test use cases. While the majority of unit tests are written in C, higher-level tests are written primarily using the Python API. Interfaces are provided for accessing DAOS management and DAOS API functionality from Python. This higher level interface allows a faster turnaround time on implementing test cases for DAOS. Layout \u00b6 The Python API is split into several files based on functionality: The Python object API: daos_api.py . The mapping of C structures to Python classes daos_cref.py High-level abstraction classes exist to manipulate DAOS storage: class DaosPool(object) class DaosContainer(object) class DaosObj(object) class IORequest(object) DaosPool is a Python class representing a DAOS pool. All pool-related functionality is exposed from this class. Operations such as creating/destroying a pool, connecting to a pool, and adding a target to a storage pool are supported. DaosContainer is a Python class representing a DAOS container. As with the DaosPool class, all container-related functionality is exposed here. This class also exposes abstracted wrapper functions for the flow of creating and committing an object to a DAOS container. DaosObj is a Python class representing a DAOS object. Functionality such as creating/deleting objects in a container, 'punching' objects (delete an object from the specified transaction only), and object query. IORequest is a Python class representing a read or write request against a DAOS object. Several classes exist for management purposes as well: class DaosContext(object) class DaosLog class DaosApiError(Exception) DaosContext is a wrapper around the DAOS libraries. It is initialized with the path where DAOS libraries can be found. DaosLog exposes functionality to write messages to the DAOS client log. DaosApiError is a custom exception class raised by the API internally in the event of a failed DAOS action. Most functions exposed in the DAOS C API support both synchronous and asynchronous execution, and the Python API exposes this same functionality. Each API takes an input event. DaosEvent is the Python representation of this event. If the input event is NULL , the call is synchronous. If an event is supplied, the function will return immediately after submitting API requests to the underlying stack and the user can poll and query the event for completion. Ctypes \u00b6 Ctypes is a built-in Python module for interfacing Python with existing libraries written in C/C++. The Python API is built as an object-oriented wrapper around the DAOS libraries utilizing ctypes. Ctypes documentation can be found here https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html The following demonstrates a simplified example of creating a Python wrapper for the C function daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out , with each input parameter to the C function being cast via ctypes. This also demonstrates struct representation via ctypes: // daos_exclude.c #include <stdio.h> int daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out(const uuid_t uuid, const char *grp, struct d_tgt_list *tgts, daos_event_t *ev); All input parameters must be represented via ctypes. If a struct is required as an input parameter, a corresponding Python class can be created. For struct d_tgt_list : struct d_tgt_list { d_rank_t *tl_ranks; int32_t *tl_tgts; uint32_t tl_nr; }; class DTgtList(ctypes.Structure): _fields_ = [(\"tl_ranks\", ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_uint32)), (\"tl_tgts\", ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int32)), (\"tl_nr\", ctypes.c_uint32)] The shared object containing daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out can then be imported and the function called directly: # api.py import ctypes import uuid import conversion # utility library to convert C <---> Python UUIDs # init python variables p_uuid = str(uuid.uuid4()) p_tgts = 2 p_ranks = DaosPool.__pylist_to_array([2]) # cast python variables via ctypes as necessary c_uuid = str_to_c_uuid(p_uuid) c_grp = ctypes.create_string_buffer(b\"daos_group_name\") c_tgt_list = ctypes.POINTER(DTgtList(p_ranks, p_tgts, 2))) # again, DTgtList must be passed as pointer # load the shared object my_lib = ctypes.CDLL('/full/path/to/daos_exclude.so') # now call it my_lib.daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out(c_uuid, c_grp, c_tgt_list, None) Error Handling \u00b6 The API was designed using the EAFP ( E asier to A sk F orgiveness than get P ermission) idiom. A given function will raise a custom exception on error state, DaosApiError . A user of the API is expected to catch and handle this exception as needed: # catch and log try: daos_some_action() except DaosApiError as e: self.d_log.ERROR(\"My DAOS action encountered an error!\") Logging \u00b6 The Python DAOS API exposes functionality to log messages to the DAOS client log. Messages can be logged as INFO , DEBUG , WARN , or ERR log levels. The DAOS log object must be initialized with the environmental context in which to run: from pydaos.raw import DaosLog self.d_log = DaosLog(self.context) self.d_log.INFO(\"FYI\") self.d_log.DEBUG(\"Debugging code\") self.d_log.WARNING(\"Be aware, may be issues\") self.d_log.ERROR(\"Something went very wrong\") Go Bindings \u00b6 API bindings for Go 2 are also available. https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/master/src/client/pydaos/raw/README.md \u21a9 https://godoc.org/github.com/daos-stack/go-daos/pkg/daos \u21a9","title":"Native Programming Interface"},{"location":"user/interface/#native-programming-interface","text":"","title":"Native Programming Interface"},{"location":"user/interface/#building-against-the-daos-library","text":"To build application or I/O middleware against the native DAOS API, include the daos.h header file in your program and link with -Ldaos .

This capability is provided by the libdfs library that implements the file and directory abstractions over the native libdaos library. The POSIX emulation can be exposed directly to applications or I/O frameworks (e.g., for frameworks like Spark or TensorFlow, or benchmarks like IOR or mdtest that support different storage backend plugins). It can also be exposed transparently via a FUSE daemon, combined optionally with an interception library to address some of the FUSE performance bottlenecks by delivering full OS bypass for POSIX read/write operations. libdfs \u00b6 The DAOS File System (DFS) is implemented in the libdfs library, and allows a DAOS container to be accessed as a hierarchical POSIX namespace. libdfs supports files, directories, and symbolic links, but not hard links. Access permissions are inherited from the parent pool and are not implemented on a per-file or per-directory basis. setuid() and setgid() programs, as well as supplementary groups, are currently not supported. It is possible to use libdfs in a parallel application from multiple nodes. When the same POSIX container is mounted concurrently by multiple processes, a few limitations exist in DAOS v1.0. In particular: Unlinking a file in one process while another process has the same file open: This may or may not cause an I/O error on the open file. The atomicity of rename operations is not guaranteed. These corner cases will be addressed in a future DAOS release. DFuse \u00b6 DFuse provides DAOS File System access through the standard libc/kernel/VFS POSIX infrastructure. This allows existing applications to use DAOS without modification, and provides a path to upgrade those applications to native DAOS support. Additionally, DFuse provides an Interception Library libioil to transparently allow POSIX clients to talk directly to DAOS servers, providing OS-Bypass for I/O without modifying or recompiling of the application. DFuse builds heavily on DFS. Data written via DFuse can be accessed by DFS and vice versa. DFuse Daemon \u00b6 The dfuse daemon runs a single instance per node to provide a user POSIX access to DAOS. It should be run with the credentials of the user, and typically will be started and stopped on each compute node as part of the prolog and epilog scripts of any resource manager or scheduler in use. One DFuse daemon per node can process requests for multiple clients. A single DFuse instance can provide access to multiple pools and containers concurrently, or can be limited to a single pool, or a single container. Restrictions \u00b6 DFuse is limited to a single user. Access to the filesystem from other users, including root, will not be honored. As a consequence of this, the chown and chgrp calls are not supported. Hard links and special device files, except symbolic links, are not supported, nor are any ACLs. DFuse can run in the foreground, keeping the terminal window open, or it can daemonize to run like a system daemon. However, to do this and still be able to access DAOS it needs to daemonize before calling daos_init() . This in turns means it cannot report some kinds of startup errors either on stdout/stderr or via its return code. When initially starting with DFuse it is recommended to run in foreground mode ( --foreground ) to better observe any failures. Inodes are managed on the local node by DFuse. So while inode numbers will be consistent on a node for the duration of the session, they are not guaranteed to be consistent across restarts of DFuse or across nodes. It is not possible to see pool/container listings through DFuse. So if readdir , ls or others are used, DFuse will return ENOTSUP . Launching \u00b6 DFuse should be run with the credentials (user/group) of the user who will be accessing it, and who owns any pools that will be used. There are two mandatory command-line options, these are: Command-line Option Description --mountpoint=<path> path to mount dfuse The mount point specified should be an empty directory on the local node that is owned by the user. Additionally, there are several optional command-line options: Command-line Option Description --pool=<uuid> pool uuid to connect to --container=<uuid> container uuid to open --sys-name=<name> DAOS system name --foreground run in foreground --singlethreaded run single threaded When DFuse starts, it will register a single mount with the kernel, at the location specified by the --mountpoint option. This mount will be visible in /proc/mounts , and possibly in the output of df . The contents of multiple pools/containers will be accessible via this single kernel mountpoint. Pool/Container Paths \u00b6 DFuse will only create one kernel level mount point regardless of how it is launched. How POSIX containers are represented within that mount point varies depending on the DFuse command-line options: If both a pool uuid and a container uuid are specified on the command line, then the mount point will map to the root of the container itself. Files can be accessed by simply concatenating the mount point and the name of the file, relative to the root of the container. If neither a pool or container is specified, then pools and container can be accessed by the path <mount point>/<pool uuid>/<container uuid> . However it should be noted that readdir() and therefore ls do not work on either mount points or directories representing pools here. So the pool and container uuids will have to be provided from an external source. If a pool uuid is specified but not a container uuid, then the containers can be accessed by the path <mount point>/<container uuid> . The container uuid will have to be provided from an external source. It is anticipated that in most cases, both pool uuid and container uuid will be used, so the mount point itself will map directly onto a POSIX container. Links into other Containers \u00b6 It is possible to link to other containers in DFuse, where subdirectories within a container resolve not to regular directories, but rather to the root of entirely different POSIX containers. To create a new container and link it into the namespace of an existing one, use the following command. $ daos container create --type POSIX --pool <pool uuid> --path <path to entry point> The pool uuid should already exist, and the path should specify a location somewhere within a DFuse mount point that resolves to a POSIX container. Once a link is created, it can be accessed through the new path. Following the link is virtually transparent. No container uuid is required. If one is not supplied, it will be created. To destroy a container again, the following command should be used. $ daos container destroy --path <path to entry point> This will both remove the link between the containers and remove the container that was linked to. There is no support for adding links to already existing containers or removing links to containers without also removing the container itself. Information about a container, for example, the presence of an entry point between containers, or the pool and container uuids of the container linked to can be read with the following command. $ daos container info --path <path to entry point> Enabling Caching \u00b6 DFuse in normal mode simply provides a communication path between the kernel and DAOS. However, this can come with a performance impact. To help alleviate this it is possible to turn on caching, both within dfuse itself and by allowing the kernel to cache certain data. Where and when data is cached, there is no attempt made to invalidate the caches based on changes to DAOS, other than simple timeouts. Enabling this option will turn on the following features: Kernel caching of dentries Kernel caching of negative dentries Kernel caching of inodes (file sizes, permissions etc) Kernel caching of file contents Readahead in dfuse and inserting data into kernel cache MMAP write optimization To turn on caching use the --enable-caching command-line option for dfuse. This will enable the feature for all accessed containers. When this option is used, the containers accessed should only be accessed from one node, so it may be necessary to create a container per node in this model. Stopping DFuse \u00b6 When done, the file system can be unmounted via fusermount: $ fusermount3 -u /tmp/daos When this is done, the local DFuse daemon should shut down the mount point, disconnect from the DAOS servers, and exit. You can also verify that the mount point is no longer listed in /proc/mounts . Interception Library \u00b6 An interception library called libioil is available to work with DFuse. This library works in conjunction with DFuse and allows the interception of POSIX I/O calls and issue the I/O operations directly from the application context through libdaos without any application changes. This provides kernel-bypass for I/O data, leading to improved performance. To use this, set LD_PRELOAD to point to the shared library in the DAOS install directory: LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/daos/install/lib/libioil.so LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libioil.so # when installed from RPMs","title":"POSIX Namespace"},{"location":"user/posix/#posix-namespace","text":"A regular POSIX namespace can be encapsulated into a DAOS container.

It is possible to use libdfs in a parallel application from multiple nodes. When the same POSIX container is mounted concurrently by multiple processes, a few limitations exist in DAOS v1.0. In particular: Unlinking a file in one process while another process has the same file open: This may or may not cause an I/O error on the open file.

DFuse can run in the foreground, keeping the terminal window open, or it can daemonize to run like a system daemon. However, to do this and still be able to access DAOS it needs to daemonize before calling daos_init() . This in turns means it cannot report some kinds of startup errors either on stdout/stderr or via its return code. When initially starting with DFuse it is recommended to run in foreground mode ( --foreground ) to better observe any failures. Inodes are managed on the local node by DFuse. So while inode numbers will be consistent on a node for the duration of the session, they are not guaranteed to be consistent across restarts of DFuse or across nodes.

Otherwise, they can be deployed by following the DAOS Installation Guide . Download DAOS Hadoop Filesystem \u00b6 There are two artifacts to download, daos-java and hadoop-daos, from maven. Here are maven dependencies. You can download them with below commands if you have maven installed. mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=io.daos:daos-java:<version> -Ddest=./ mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=io.daos:hadoop-daos:<version> -Ddest=./ Or search these artifacts from maven central(https://search.maven.org) and download them manually. You can also build artifacts by yourself. see Build Daos Hadoop Filesystem for details. Deploy DAOS Hadoop Filesystem \u00b6 daos-java-<version>.jar and hadoop-daos-<version>.jar \u00b6 They need to be deployed on every compute node that runs Spark or Hadoop. Place them in a directory, e.g., $SPARK_HOME/jars for Spark and $HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/lib for Hadoop, which is accessible to all the nodes or copy them to every node. daos-site-example.xml \u00b6 Extract from hadoop-daos-<version>.jar and rename to daos-site.xml . Then copy it to your application config directory, e.g., $SPARK_HOME/conf for Spark and $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop for Hadoop. Configure Hadoop \u00b6 DAOS Environment Variable \u00b6 Export all DAOS-specific env variables in your application, e.g., spark-env.sh for Spark and hadoop-env.sh for Hadoop. Or you can simply put env variables in your .bashrc . Besides, you should have LD_LIBRARY_PATH include DAOS library path so that Java can link to DAOS libs, like below. $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<DAOS_INSTALL>/lib64:<DAOS_INSTALL>/lib Set DAOS URI and Pool/Container \u00b6 In daos-site.xml , we default the DAOS URI as simplest form, \"daos:///\". For other form of URIs, please check DAOS More URIs . If the DAOS pool and container have not been created, we can use the following command to create them and get the pool UUID and container UUID. $ dmg pool create --scm-size=<scm size> --nvme-size=<nvme size> $ daos cont create --pool <pool UUID> --type POSIX After that, configure daos-site.xml with the pool and container created. <configuration> ... <property> <name>fs.daos.pool.uuid</name> <value>your pool UUID</value> <description>UUID of DAOS pool</description> </property> <property> <name>fs.daos.container.uuid</name> <value>your container UUID</value> <description>UUID of DAOS container created with \"--type posix\"</description> </property> ... </configuration> Please put daos-site.xml in right place, e.g., Java classpath, and loadable by Hadoop DAOS FileSystem. Validate Hadoop Access \u00b6 If everything goes well, you should see /user directory being listed after issuing below command. $ hadoop fs -ls / You can also play around with other Hadoop commands, like -copyFromLocal and -copyToLocal. You can also start Yarn and run some mapreduce jobs on Yarn. See Run Map-Reduce in Hadoop Configure Spark \u00b6 To access DAOS Hadoop filesystem in Spark, add the jar files to the classpath of the Spark executor and driver. This can be configured in Spark's configuration file spark-defaults.conf . spark.executor.extraClassPath /path/to/daos-java-<version>.jar:/path/to/hadoop-daos-<version>.jar spark.driver.extraClassPath /path/to/daos-java-<version>.jar:/path/to/hadoop-daos-<version>.jar Validate Spark Access \u00b6 All Spark APIs that work with the Hadoop filesystem will work with DAOS. We can use the daos:/// URI to access files stored in DAOS. For example, to read the people.json file from the root directory of DAOS filesystem, we can use the following pySpark code: df = spark.read.json(\"daos:///people.json\") Appendix \u00b6 Build DAOS Hadoop Filesystem \u00b6 Below are the steps to build the Java jar files for the DAOS Java and DAOS Hadoop filesystem. Spark and Hadoop require these jars in their classpath. You can ignore this section if you already have the pre-built jars. $ git clone https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git $ cd daos $ git checkout <desired branch or commit> ## assume DAOS is built and installed to <daos_install> directory $ cd src/client/java ## with-proto3-netty4-deps profile builds jars with protobuf 3 and netty-buffer 4 shaded ## It spares you potential third-party jar compatibility issue. $ mvn -Pdistribute,with-proto3-netty4-deps clean package -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip -Ddaos.install.path=<daos_install> After build, the package daos-java-<version>-assemble.tgz will be available under distribution/target . DAOS More URIs \u00b6 DAOS FileSystem binds to schema \"daos\". DAOS URIs are in the format of \"daos://[authority]//[path]\". Both authority and path are optional. There are three types of DAOS URIs, DAOS UNS path, DAOS Non-UNS path and Special UUID path depending on where you want the DAOS Filesystem to get initialized and configured. DAOS UNS Path \u00b6 The simple form of URI is \"daos:///\\<your uns path>[/sub path]\". \"\\<your path>\" is your OS file path created with the daos command or Java DAOS UNS method, DaosUns.create() . The \"[sub path]\" is optional. You can create the UNS path with below command. $ daos cont create --pool <pool UUID> -path <your path> --type=POSIX Or $ java -Dpath=\"your path\" -Dpool_id=\"your pool uuid\" -cp ./daos-java-<version>-shaded.jar io.daos.dfs.DaosUns create After creation, you can use below command to see what DAOS properties set to the path. $ getfattr -d -m - <your path> DAOS Non-UNS Path \u00b6 Check Set DAOS URI and Pool/Container . Special UUID Path \u00b6 DAOS supports a specialized URI with pool/container UUIDs embedded. The format is \"daos://pool UUID/container UUID\". As you can see, we don't need to find the UUIDs from neither UNS path nor configuration like above two types of URIs. You may want to connect to two DAOS servers or two DFS instances mounted to different containers in one DAOS server from same JVM. Then, you need to add authority to your URI to make it unique since Hadoop caches filesystem instance keyed by \"schema + authority\" in global (JVM). It applies to the both types of URIs described above. Run Map-Reduce in Hadoop \u00b6 Edit $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml to change fs.defaultFS to daos:/// . It is not recommended to set fs.defaultFS to a DAOS UNS path. You may get an error complaining pool/container UUIDs cannot be found. It's because Hadoop considers the default filesystem is DAOS since you configured DAOS UNS URI. YARN has some working directories defaulting to local path without schema, like \"/tmp/yarn\", which is then constructed as \"daos:///tmp/yarn\". With this URI, Hadoop cannot connect to DAOS since no pool/container UUIDs can be found if daos-site.xml is not provided too. . Then append below configuration to this file and $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/yarn-site.xml . <property> <name>fs.AbstractFileSystem.daos.impl</name> <value>io.daos.fs.hadoop.DaosAbsFsImpl</value> </property> DAOS has no data locality since it is remote storage. You need to add below configuration to the scheduler configuration file, like capacity-scheduler.xml in yarn. <property> <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.node-locality-delay</name> <value>-1</value> </property> Then replicate daos-site.xml , core-site.xml , yarn-site.xml and capacity-scheduler.xml to other nodes. Known Issues \u00b6 If you use Omni-path PSM2 provider in DAOS, you'll get connection issue in Yarn container due to PSM2 resource not being released properly in time. Tune More Configurations \u00b6 If your DAOS URI is the non-UNS, you can follow descriptions of each config item to set your own values in loadable daos-site.xml . If your DAOS URI is the UNS path, your configurations, except those set by DAOS UNS creation, in daos-site.xml can still be effective. To make configuration source consistent, an alternative to the configuration file daos-site.xml is to set all configurations to the UNS path. You put the configs to the same UNS path with below command. # install attr package if get \"command not found\" error $ setfattr -n user.daos.hadoop -v \"fs.daos.server.group=daos_server\" <your path> Or $ java -Dpath=\"your path\" -Dattr=user.daos.hadoop -Dvalue=\"fs.daos.server.group=daos_server\" -cp ./daos-java-<version>-shaded.jar io.daos.dfs.DaosUns setappinfo For the \"value\" property, you need to follow pattern, key1=value1:key2=value2.. .. And key should be from daos-site-example.xml . If value contains characters of '=' or ':', you need to escape the value with below command. $ java -Dop=escape-app-value -Dinput=\"daos_server:1=2\" -cp ./daos-java-<version>-shaded.jar io.daos.dfs.DaosUns util You'll get escaped value, \"daos_server\\u003a1\\u003d2\", for \"daos_server:1=2\". If you configure the same property in both daos-site.xml and UNS path, the value in daos-site.xml takes priority. If user sets Hadoop configuration before initializing Hadoop DAOS FileSystem, the user's configuration takes priority. PSM2 Issue \u00b6 For some libfabric providers, like PSM2, signal chaining should be enabled to better interoperate with DAOS and its dependencies which may install its own signal handlers. It ensures that signal calls are intercepted so that they do not actually replace the JVM's signal handlers if the handlers conflict with those already installed by the JVM. Instead, these calls save the new signal handlers, or \"chain\" them behind the JVM-installed handlers. Later, when any of these signals are raised and found not to be targeted at the JVM, the DAOS's handlers are invoked. $ export LD_PRELOAD=<YOUR JDK HOME>/jre/lib/amd64/libjsig.so","title":"Spark and Hadoop"},{"location":"user/spark/#getting-started-with-the-daos-hadoop-filesystem","text":"Prerequisites Download DAOS Hadoop Filesystem Deploy DAOS Hadoop Filesystem Configure Hadoop Configure Spark Appendix Here, we describe the quick steps required to use the DAOS Hadoop filesystem to access DAOS from Hadoop and Spark.","title":"Getting Started with the DAOS Hadoop Filesystem"},{"location":"user/spark/#prerequisites","text":"Linux OS Java 8 Hadoop 2.7.6 Spark 3 DAOS Readiness We assume that the DAOS servers and agents have already been deployed in the environment.

You put the configs to the same UNS path with below command. # install attr package if get \"command not found\" error $ setfattr -n user.daos.hadoop -v \"fs.daos.server.group=daos_server\" <your path> Or $ java -Dpath=\"your path\" -Dattr=user.daos.hadoop -Dvalue=\"fs.daos.server.group=daos_server\" -cp ./daos-java-<version>-shaded.jar io.daos.dfs.DaosUns setappinfo For the \"value\" property, you need to follow pattern, key1=value1:key2=value2.. .. And key should be from daos-site-example.xml . If value contains characters of '=' or ':', you need to escape the value with below command. $ java -Dop=escape-app-value -Dinput=\"daos_server:1=2\" -cp ./daos-java-<version>-shaded.jar io.daos.dfs.DaosUns util You'll get escaped value, \"daos_server\\u003a1\\u003d2\", for \"daos_server:1=2\". If you configure the same property in both daos-site.xml and UNS path, the value in daos-site.xml takes priority. If user sets Hadoop configuration before initializing Hadoop DAOS FileSystem, the user's configuration takes priority.","title":"Tune More Configurations"},{"location":"user/spark/#psm2-issue","text":"For some libfabric providers, like PSM2, signal chaining should be enabled to better interoperate with DAOS and its dependencies which may install its own signal handlers. It ensures that signal calls are intercepted so that they do not actually replace the JVM's signal handlers if the handlers conflict with those already installed by the JVM. Instead, these calls save the new signal handlers, or \"chain\" them behind the JVM-installed handlers. Later, when any of these signals are raised and found not to be targeted at the JVM, the DAOS's handlers are invoked. $ export LD_PRELOAD=<YOUR JDK HOME>/jre/lib/amd64/libjsig.so","title":"PSM2 Issue"}]}
